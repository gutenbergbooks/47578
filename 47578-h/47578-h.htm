<p class="drop-cap">THE following pages consist, in part, of a reprint
of the little volume published in 1858 under
the title of <i>Manchester Walks and Wild&ndash;Flowers</i>;&mdash;in
part, of brief <i>excerpta</i> from the
author&#8217;s accounts of trips made by the Field
Naturalists&#8217; Society, as given in their Annual Reports,
1860&ndash;1881. A very considerable amount of new matter
will also be found.</p>

<p>Giving descriptions in a novel and welcome manner,
of pretty places in the neighbourhood previously unknown
to people in general, and indicating in various ways the
pleasure to be derived from rambles in the country, the
little volume spoken of is believed to have assisted, in no
slight measure, to awaken and foster the present widespread
local taste for rural scenes, and for recreation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the pursuit of practical natural history. It is in the hope
that similar results may ensue among the present generation
that the book is now partially republished. It has
long been unprocurable, and is constantly enquired for.
The reprinting presents also a curious and interesting
picture of many local conditions now effaced.</p>

<p>The preface to the original work of 1858 contained
the following passages:&mdash;&#8220;No grown&ndash;up person who has
resided in Manchester even twenty years, is unacquainted
with the mighty changes that have passed over its
suburbs during that period; while those who have lived
here thirty, forty, and fifty years tell us of circumstances
and conditions almost incredible. Neighbourhoods once
familiar as delightful rural solitudes, are now covered
with houses, and densely crowded with population; the
pleasant field&ndash;paths we trod in our youth have disappeared,
and in their stead are long lines of pavement,
lighted with gas, and paced by the policeman. In a few
years it is not improbable that places described in the
following pages as rustic and sylvan will have shared the
same fate, and be as purely historical as Garratt Wood
and Ordsall Clough. The Botany of the district will to
a certain extent be similarly affected. No longer than
fifteen years ago &#40;<i>i.e.</i> in 1840&#41; the fields by St. George&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
Church, in the Chester Road, were blue every March
and April with the spring crocus, and on the very spot
where Platt Church now lifts its tall and graceful spire,
there was a large pond filled with the <i>Stratiotes</i>, or water&ndash;aloe.
If the past be a prognostic of the future, it is easy
to guess what will happen to other things, and to understand
how in half a century hence our present &#8216;Walks&#8217;
will have become as obsolete as their author, and the
entire subject require a new and livelier treatment. A
descriptive history of the suburbs of Manchester as they
were fifty years ago, would be a most interesting and
valuable item of our local literature. It would be as
curious to the lover of bygones as this book of to&ndash;day may
perhaps appear to the Manchester people of <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1900.
How extraordinary would be the facts may be judged
from the following extracts from De Quincey, whose
youth, it is well known, was passed in the neighbourhood
of Manchester. Mark first what he says of the <i>place</i> he
lived in. &#8216;And if, after the manner of the Emperor
Aurelius, I should return thanks to Providence for all the
separate blessings of my early situation, these four I
would single out as worthy of special consideration,&mdash;that
I lived in a <i>rustic solitude</i>; that this solitude was in
England; that my infant feelings were moulded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
gentlest of sisters; and finally, that I and they were
dutiful and loving members of a pure, and holy, and
magnificent church.&#8217; And now mark where lay this
&#8216;rustic solitude.&#8217; He is describing the expected return
of his father:&mdash;&#8216;It was a summer evening of unusual
solemnity. The servants and four of us children were
gathered for hours on the lawn before the house, listening
for the sound of wheels. Sunset came, nine, ten, eleven
o&#8217;clock, and nearly another hour had passed without a
warning sound, for Greenhay, being so <i>solitary a house</i>,
formed a &#8220;terminus ad quem,&#8221; beyond which was nothing
but a cluster of cottages, composing the little hamlet of
Greenhill; so that any sound of wheels coming from the
<i>country lane which then connected us with the Rusholme
Road</i>, carried with it of necessity, a warning summons to
prepare for visitors at Greenhay.&#8217; &#8216;Greenhay&#8217; was the
centre of the modern Greenheys, and the &#8216;hamlet of
Greenhill&#8217; the predecessor of the present Greenhill
Terrace.&#8221;</p>

<p>The changes foreboded have to an extent not unimportant,
already come to pass. Almost the whole of the
great suburb which includes the Alexandra Park has
grown up since about 1860, effacing meadows and corn&ndash;fields.
In the contemplation of this new scene of busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
life there is pleasure, since it signifies human welfare and
enjoyment. In other directions, unhappily, the change
has been for the worse, as indicated in the notes to the
original portraiture of Boggart&ndash;hole Clough, Mere Clough,
and the Reddish Valley. Before deciding to visit any
particular place in the immediate neighbourhood of the
town it will be prudent, accordingly, to read to the end.
Never mind. Few things ever go absolutely. Against
the losses we are able to put the opportunities for enjoyment
in localities opened up by recent railway extensions,&mdash;places
quite as charming as the extinguished ones&mdash;it
is simply a question now of a little longer travel.</p>

<p>The present volume, be it remembered, is neither a
gazetteer nor an itinerary. The limits are too narrow for
its making pretensions even to be a Guide&ndash;book, though
the style, often, I am aware, too swift and abbreviated,
may give it the semblance of one;&mdash;it proposes only to
supply hints as to where and how to secure country
pastimes. While constrained to leave many places with
only a touch, others have been treated so admirably by
Mr. Earwaker, Mr. Croston, and Mr. Waugh, that to
tread the same ground would, on my own part, be alike
needless and ungraceful. Others again I have described
only within these few months in the &#8220;Lancashire,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
to which work I may be permitted to refer the reader for
particulars not here given.</p>

<p>Except in some few instances, I have not cared either
to give minute directions as to paths and gates. One of
the grand charms of a rural ramble consists in the sensation,
at times, of being slightly and agreeably lost; to say
nothing of the pleasure which comes of being called
upon to employ our own wits, instead of always asking,
like a child, to be led by the hand.</p>

<p>If, when visited, some of the places seem over&ndash;praised,
it must further be understood that the descriptions are
of their appearance in pleasant weather, in sunshine,
and when cherished companions help to make the hours
glad. I can say no more than that the descriptions are
faithful as regards my own experience, and that I hope
earnestly they may become true to the experience of
every one else. From this point of view the little book
is a kind of record of what I have seen and felt during
forty years.</p>

<p>Nothing has been written for mere &#8220;cheap&ndash;trippers.&#8221;
The book is addressed to the intelligent, the peaceful,
and the cultivated; those who, when they visit the country,
desire to profit by its inestimable sweet lessons. In
many parts it is addressed especially to the young, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
have ductile material in them, and are the hope of the
future for us all. Neither has it been written for learned
botanists or antiquaries. The botanical details are
simply such as it is hoped may encourage the beginner.
My main desire is to be educational, and by this I would
be judged.</p>

<p>Many of the places described or referred to are strictly
private. Permission to view them must therefore be
asked some days before. Common&ndash;sense and the
courtesy of civilized beings will prescribe in every case
the proper method of procedure.</p>

<p>I have, in conclusion, to express my thanks to the
artists who have so pleasingly illustrated the work, Mr.
W. Morton, and very particularly, Mr. Thos. Letherbrow.</p>

<p>By some odd <i>lapsus calami</i> the passage from
Wordsworth on <a href="#Page_139">page 139</a> has been mis&ndash;written. The
third line should read, &#8220;So was it when <i>my life began</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WIDE as may be the circle covered by a great
town, we come to the country at last. Let
the bricks and mortar stride far as they
will over the greensward, there are always
sanctuaries beyond&mdash;sweet spots where
we may yet listen to the singing of the
birds, and pluck the early primrose and
anemone. We need but take our survey from a sufficiently
high point, to see that the vastest mass of houses
ever heaped together by man is still only an encampment
in the fields. Like the waves of the sea upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
shores of the islands, the surge of the yellow corn is still
close upon our borders. We need but turn our faces
fondly towards rural things and rural sights, and we shall
find them.</p>

<p>Manchester itself, grim, flat, smoky Manchester, with
its gigantic suburb ever on the roll further into the plain,
and scouts from its great army of masons posted on every
spot available for hostile purposes,&mdash;Manchester itself
denies to no one of its five hundred thousand, who is
blessed with health and strength, the amenities and
genial influences of the country. True, we have no
grand scenery; no Clyde, no Ben Lomond, no Leigh
Woods, no St. Vincent&#8217;s Rocks, no Clevedon, no Durdham
Down; our rivers are anything but limpid; our
mountains are far away, upon the horizon; our lakes owe
less to nature than to art; as for waterfalls, we have
none but in our portfolios. Still is our town bosomed in
beauty. Though the magnificent and the romantic be
wanting, we have meadows trimmed with wild&ndash;flowers,
the scent of the new&ndash;mown hay and the purple clover;
we have many a sweet sylvan walk where we may hear</p>

<p class="center small">
The burnie wimplin&#8217; doon the glen,<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">and many a grateful pathway under the mingled boughs
of beech and chestnut. Next to a fine woman, the most
delightful object in creation is a noble and well&ndash;grown
tree,&mdash;a group of such trees always reminds us of a bevy
of fair ladies; and dull and unthankful must be the man
who, in the tranquil and sacred shades of Alderley and
Dunham, cannot realise to himself the most genuine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
heartfelt pleasure that trees and woods can give. If they
be not so sumptuous as the oaks of Worcestershire, or so
stately as the elms of Surrey, our trees are as leafy and
as green, and their shadows fall as softly on the summer
afternoon. The great secret in the enjoyment of nature,
as in our intercourse with society, is to look at its objects
in a friendly light, to make the most of them, such as
they are; not invidiously contrasting them with certain
other objects at a distance, but recognising that absolute
and positive beauty which is possessed by the very
humblest. Superadd to this the habit of connecting our
own feelings and emotions with the forms of nature, and,
however wanting in attractions to the mere adulator of
&#8220;fine scenery,&#8221; every little flower, every bend of the
branches, and sweet concurrent play of light and shade,
every pendent shadow in the stream, becomes animated
with a meaning and a power of satisfying such as none
but those who accustom themselves to look for it <i>here</i>,
can find in the most favoured and spacious landscape.
Justly to appreciate the wonderful and rare, we must first
learn to regard with a tender and intimate affection the
common and the unpretending; in the degree that we
withdraw from the latter, treating it with indifference or
contempt, as surely does our capacity diminish for the
former. The common things of earth are the most
gracious gifts of God. None of us extract their full
value, yet every man holds it in his power to make himself
tenfold happier by a wise use of them. For true and
continuous enjoyment of life is not attained by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
gratification of high&ndash;flown and artificial wants, connected
in large measure with the idea of pounds, shillings, and
pence. It is found in the culture of love for common
things, the untaxed game that no man can deprive us of,
and which constitute the chief part of the beauties of the
country. Hence the worth of nature to the poor. If
the rich have their gardens and hothouses, here are
flower&ndash;beds and parks, fresh from God&#8217;s own hand, without
money, and without price, and greater than the
estates of all the nobles in the kingdom. Hence, too,
coming close to home, we may see how little reason we
have to lament the absence of the grand and wonderful,
since nothing less than total nakedness of surface can
take from a place its power to interest and please.</p>

<p>While adapted to give true pleasure, if looked for in a
kindly spirit, no less fertile is our neighbourhood in
materials for a large and practical culture of natural
science. Most of the sciences may be cultivated by
Manchester residents to perfection. For geology there
are certainly fewer advantages than invite men to it in
the neighbourhood of some other large inland towns.
But what scope there is for botany and entomology is
attested by the numbers of students of both these charming
sciences who have adorned the ranks of our working
men during the last half century.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Caley, Hobson,
Crozier,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Crowther, Horsefield, among those no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in this life; Percival, Carter, Evans,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> still among us,
have reflected honour upon Manchester as a spontaneous
working men&#8217;s college of natural history, such as might
deservedly be envied by the proudest institution in the
land. These men acquired their knowledge in the
scenes we speak of, and from nature&#8217;s &#8220;common things.&#8221;
The plants of the fields and hedgerows, the insects of
the moors, were their inspiration and instruction, the
source at the same moment of a thorough and pure
delight; for while they are the least expensive of
pleasures, the naturalist&#8217;s are also the truest and most
abiding. No one inexperienced in botany would imagine
how many wild&ndash;flowers are found growing about Manchester.
Taking the area which would be marked out
by measuring a circle round the Exchange, fifteen miles
from it in every direction, six hundred different species
were catalogued in 1840.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Buxton&#8217;s &#8220;Guide,&#8221; printed in
1849, included one hundred and fifty others, mostly
accidental omissions from the earlier list. Our own
&#8220;Manchester Flora,&#8221; 1858, in which everything is brought
up to that time, contains over twenty more, though, in
consequence of the diversity of opinion as to what plants
should legitimately be included, the figures are probably
much about the same as in the &#8220;Guide,&#8221; namely, seven
hundred and fifty. These seven hundred and fifty comprise
the flowering plants, the trees, and the ferns. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
number of mosses, fungi, lichens, and other flowerless
plants, usually regarded as a separate subject of study, is in
the aggregate probably quite as great, making a total of
some one thousand five hundred perfectly distinct forms.
Not that they are all equally abundant. We must distinguish
between what botanists call the &#8220;Flora&#8221; of a given
district, and its vegetation. The &#8220;Flora&#8221; may be large,
and yet the mass of the vegetation consist of but few
different kinds, the same plants repeated over and over
again, as when hills are covered for miles together
with heath and whortleberries. Such is the case with
Manchester. Though there are seven hundred and fifty
different kinds of flowers and ferns contained in our
&#8220;Flora,&#8221; probably not half the number go to constitute
the general herbage of the district. Some species are
very rarely met with, only once in the season perhaps.
But this is so much the more pleasing to the botanist,
since it keeps his enthusiasm vigorously alive. In
addition to the living objects of interest so freely supplied
by the fields and woodlands, Manchester naturalists have
a singular privilege in the local Free Libraries and
museums. The museum at Peel Park is in many departments
rich and extensive, and nowhere in the world can
we consult books of greater value, or illustrated more
magnificently, than are to be had for the asking in Camp
Field,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> at the Chetham College, and again at Peel Park.
All three of these admirable libraries contain works on
botany and entomology which it is really melancholy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
think are so little known by the bulk of our town&#8217;s
people, when they might contribute to an almost endless
delight. Let it not be supposed that we are speaking of
botany, entomology, etc., as proper to be made the chief
business of life. &#8220;A man,&#8221; said Dr. Johnson, &#8220;is never
so well employed as when he is earning money.&#8221; Yes.
One of the best friends a man has in the world is a
good round balance at his banker&#8217;s, the fruit and reward
of his own toil. We speak of them as employments for
the <i>intervals</i> of business, which it is quite as important to
occupy carefully and diligently as the hours of business
themselves. The more delight derived from the contemplation
and study of nature a man can pack into his
leisure moments, the keener, it is certain, will be his
aptitude for his ordinary duties. It is not only delight
of spirit either that comes of attention to nature; there
are the salutary effects of it upon the body. Rambling
in the fields, the town&ndash;cobwebs get dusted out of one&#8217;s
lungs, and the whole frame becomes buoyant and elastic.
Good as is a bathe in the cold water, scarcely inferior,
when the skin is clean, is a good bathe in the blowing
wind.</p>

<p>With these inducements and recommendations to the
love of nature so amply spread before us, we purpose
introducing our readers to the principal scenes of rural
beauty in the immediate neighbourhood, those sweet
side&ndash;chapels in the grand cathedral which no locality is
absolutely without. The experience of half a life&ndash;time
has shown us that no trifling source of pleasure is such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
familiarity with nature as we hope to encourage. Days
gone by are made brighter to recollection; the present
are filled with the same pleasures; for it is the peculiar
property of the happiness induced by the love of nature,
that if we are trained in youth to seek and find it, when
we are old it will not depart from us;&mdash;even the future is
made cheerful and inviting by the certainty that, leaving
us our eyes, nature for her part will never grow old nor
look shabby, not even in winter, which is decorated in
its own way, but will always, like the Graces, be young
and lovely. That which truly keeps life going is sensibility
to the romance of nature. Youth and age are
measured fictitiously if we count only by birthdays.
Some things always find us young, and make us young,
and though love and kindness may be the best known of
these, none act more powerfully than does the sweet
smile of living nature. It is in conversing with nature,
moreover, that we learn how foolish are affectation and
sentimentalism; how poor we are in leisure for mournful
musing and fruitless reverie; that the truest and most
precious pleasures are those which are the manliest; how
rich we are in opportunities for affection and generosity.
The facilities for reaching the most charming and
sequestered spots are now so great and manifold that no
one need be a stranger to them. It is not as some
fifteen years ago,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> when they were only to be reached by
a long walk, which consumed the half of one&#8217;s time, or
by a specially engaged conveyance, the expense of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
compelled one&#8217;s excursions to be like the angels&#8217; visits,
few and far between. The railways, penetrating every
nook and corner, now enable us to reach the very heart
of the country in a very little while, fresh and nimble
for our enjoyment, and, when over, the same will
bring us home again. Honoured for ever be the name
of Stephenson! It is in facilitating men&#8217;s intercourse
with nature, and the purest and most ennobling recreations
they can enjoy and are capable of, that the social
blessings of railways have their highest realisation. Vast
is their use to commerce, but still vaster their unreckoned
friendship to health and healthy&ndash;mindedness. Now, also,
there are more persons prepared to supply our wants in
the way of &#8220;Tired nature&#8217;s sweet restorer, balmy <i>tea</i>.&#8221;
Time was when the alehouse by the roadside, or the
weary walk back to town, were the only choice open to
our poor hunger and fatigue. But with the Saturday
half&ndash;holiday, and the impetus it gave to rural visitings,
there has sprung up a readiness on the part of country
folks to open their doors in a hospitable spirit, which is
quite tempting and delightful; and, most assuredly,
nothing forms so pleasant a conclusion to an afternoon&#8217;s
ramble as to sit down in a neat cottage to a comfortable
farmhouse meal, with its huge broad piles of bread and
butter, and inexhaustible store of green salad and new&ndash;laid
eggs. There, with the sun shining aslant through
the old&ndash;fashioned window, the doors open, and the breeze
gently peeping in, the cows lowing in the pasture,
and the very atmosphere redolent of the country, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
realise the fine hearty pleasurableness of a good appetite,
such as only the open air can induce, and learn the sweet
savour of the plainest diet when wisely earned. And
this not only because of the relish which comes of the
exercise in the fresh air, but of the higher relish born of
that mutual satisfaction and kind feeling which always
follows a friendly visit to Dame Nature. People never
feel more attached to one another than when they have
been enjoying the charms of nature together; while the
rose mounts to the cheek, the glow comes upon the
heart. We should court nature therefore, not only for
our own private and personal good, but if we would
quicken our reciprocal affections. Especially with regard
to this latter point, is it valuable to have some definite
pursuit&mdash;something to attend to in particular when we
go out for an afternoon&#8217;s or evening&#8217;s walk. A stroll
in the fields is at all times good and healthful, but when
two or three go out together to look for plants, or in
search of curious insects, or to watch the movements, the
manners and customs of the birds, quite unconsciously
there get established new and pleasing links of sympathy,
which lead to happiest results, both to head and
heart. Some of the firmest friendships that we know of
have had their origin in the exchange of ideas over a
wild&ndash;flower. One of the noblest prerogatives of nature is
to make men friends with one another. In the town we
stand apart, excited and repelled by selfish and rival
interests; but in the tranquillity of the fields and woods,
united in delightful and invigorating pursuits, jealousies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
are forgotten, every man is an equal and a brother. Not
the least useful end either, that flows from culture of love
of the country, and particularly of some science having
reference to natural objects, is the perennial employment
it supplies for leisure hours at <i>home</i>. Half the mischief
that boys commit comes of their having no intelligent
and useful occupation for their playtime. As large a
portion of the lax morality of their elders may be referred
to the same cause. A naturalist never has any idle
moments; if he be not at work in the country, he is busy
with his curiosities indoors. Little private collections of
natural objects, such as dried plants, insects, fossils, or
shells, are always valuable, and always pretty, and a perpetual
fund of interest and amusement. To gather
together such things is not only highly instructive,
and an agreeable pursuit, through the prolonged and
intelligent observation which it demands; it is useful
also as feeding the pleasure of possession&mdash;a noble and
worthy one when well directed; and it has the yet higher
recommendation of providing a diary and immortal
record of past pleasures. A volume of dried plants,
gathered on occasions of memorable enjoyment, becomes
in a few years inexpressibly precious, an aid to memory,
and thus to the perpetuity of those enjoyments, which
even pictures give less perfectly, for here we have the
very things themselves that were handled and looked at
during those bright and fleeting moments. Such a
volume of memorial&ndash;plants now lies on the table before
us, spreading before the mind the souvenirs of forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
years. In another part of this little book will be found
instructions as to the method of commencing such collections.
Meanwhile, we have cordially to recommend the
idea to our readers, especially the young, and invite them
to accompany us in these rambles.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE part of the country round Manchester
which supplies the greatest number of
different wild&ndash;flowers, and of rare kinds in
particular, is unquestionably the neighbourhood
of Bowdon. Next in botanical interest
come the Reddish valley, extending from
Stockport to near Hyde, the Disley hills, and
the delightful woods in the neighbourhood of Marple; and
next to these again, and perhaps equalling them, Worsley,
Tyldesley, the northern side of Prestwich, and the
vicinity of Clifton. Bowdon, however, with the adjacent
districts of Lymm and Cotterill, stands ahead of all. It
holds precedence, too, in respect of its early seasons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
While other portions of our district are scarcely giving
signs of vernal life, at Bowdon the spring flowers are
often open and abundant, and this quite as markedly in
the fields as in the gardens. The former is the more
valuable and interesting part of the testimony thus borne
to the mildness of Bowdon, since the life of cultivated
plants is always in some measure artificial, or under the
influence of human direction, whereas the occupants of
the hedgerows are pure children of nature. In the
pleasant little nook called Ashley meadows, lingering
with its very latest campanula and crimsoned bramble&ndash;leaf,
Autumn seems hardly gone before Spring prepares
to change all again and once more to green. Dunham
Park offers nothing important for several weeks after the
Ashley meadows have flowers to show. The total,
indeed, of the botanical productions of the former place
is not a fifth of what may be found within a mile of
Ashley Mill. It is well to note this, because many
people suppose that a scene delightful in its picturesque is
correspondingly rich in wild&ndash;flowers. Generally, no doubt,
it is so, since the picturesque in scenery is almost always
connected with great unevenness of surface, precipitous
descents, rocks, and tumbling waters, these usually
coming in turn, of geological conditions, such as are
highly conducive to variety in the Flora. But when the
charm of a scene depends, not on cliffs and cataracts, but
simply on the agreeable intermixture of differently&ndash;tinted
trees, a gently undulating surface, sweet vistas and
arcades of meeting branches, and the allurements held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
out to the imagination by green forbidden paths and
tangled thickets;&mdash;then, as in Dunham Park, the primitive
causes of floral variety being absent, the flowers
themselves, though they may be plentiful in their
respective kinds, are necessarily few as to distinct species.
It does not follow that where the variety is considerable
we are to look below the turf for the explanation.
Meadows and pastures are always more prolific than
ground covered with forest&ndash;trees &#40;except, perhaps, in the
tropics&#41;, the reason being partly that such trees offer too
much obstruction to the rays of the sun, and partly that
their immense and spreading roots block up the soil and
hinder the growth of smaller plants. The Ashley
meadows, after all, like all other places abounding in
wild&ndash;flowers, are the <i>miniature</i> of a romantic scene. For
in landscape, as in history, wherever we go, we have only
the same ideas on a larger or smaller scale, the great
repeated in the little, the little repeated in the great.
Here is the mighty forest, clinging to the mountain&ndash;side;
here the extended plain, watered by its winding river;
here the terrible chasm and deep ravine,&mdash;all, however,
in that delicate and reduced measure which, while it
gives us the type of nature universally, enables us to see
the whole at one view.</p>

<p>To get to the Ashley meadows, go by the railway to
Bowdon, then along the &#8220;Ashley Road&#8221; for about a mile,
and then down the lane on the left hand, which leads to
Mr. Nield&#8217;s model farm. After passing through the field
by the farm, there is seen a small wood upon the right, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
which are many beautiful treasures, and descending a
little, we are in the meadows, the Bollin flowing at the
farther edge, and the mill, with its weir and water&ndash;wheel,
at the extremity. The very earliest spring flowers to be
gathered here are those of the hazel&ndash;nut, the willow, the
alder, and the poplar. People unacquainted with botany
often suppose that the latter and other timber&ndash;trees
belong to the flowerless class of plants. They fancy that
flowers occur only upon fruit&ndash;trees, and upon ornamental
shrubs, such as the lilac and laburnum. The mistake is
a perfectly natural and excusable one, seeing that the
established idea of a flower is of something brilliant and
highly coloured. A visit to the Ashley meadows in the
month of April soon shows that there are other flowers
than these. The hazel is by that time overblown, being
in perfection about February; but the other trees mentioned
above are covered with their curious blossoms,
which in every case come out before the leaves. Those
of the alder and poplar resemble pendent caterpillars, of
a fine brownish red; the willow&ndash;blooms are in dense
clusters, green or lively yellow, according to their sex.
For plants, like animals, have sex, and though in most
cases male and female co&ndash;exist in the same flower, it
happens with some, especially with the timber&ndash;trees of
northern latitudes, that the flowers are of only one sex,
some of them being male and others female. Occasionally
the entire tree is male only or female only&mdash;the
condition of the willow and the poplar, the yellow flowers
of the former of which are the male, and the greenish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
ones the female. On the hedge&ndash;banks below these trees
may be gathered the dogs&#8217; mercury, an herbaceous plant
of distinct sexes, readily recognised by its dark green,
oval, pointed leaves. Soon after the appearance of these,
the banks and open sunny spots become decked with the
glossy yellow blossoms of the celandine, a flower resembling
a butter&ndash;cup, but with eight or nine long and narrow
petals, instead of five rounded ones. Mingled with it
here and there is the musk&ndash;root, a singular but unpretending
little plant, green in every part, and with its
blossoms collected into a cube&ndash;shaped cluster, a flower
turned to each of the four points of the compass, and one
looking right up to the zenith. The roots, as implied in
the name, have the odour of musk. On the moister
banks, such as those at the lower edge of the wood,
grows also the golden saxifrage, a pretty little plant, with
flat tufts of minute yellowish bloom. Yellow, in different
shades, prevails to a remarkable extent among English
wild&ndash;flowers, and especially those of spring. The rich
living yellow of the coltsfoot is a conspicuous example.
The coltsfoot flowers, like those of the poplar tree,
open before the leaves, enlivening the bare waysides in
the most beautiful manner, or at least when the sun
shines; for so dependent are they upon the light, that it
is only when the sun falls warm and animating that they
expand their delicate rays, slender as the finest needle,
and reminding us, in their elegant circle and luminous
colour, of the aureola round the head of a saint in
Catholic pictures. At first sight, the coltsfoot might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mistaken for a small dandelion. It is easily distinguishable
from that despised, but useful plant, by the scales
upon its stem, the stalk of the dandelion being perfectly
smooth. The leaves and flowers of the dandelion open,
moreover, simultaneously. The coltsfoot, like the flower
it imitates, holds high repute among the &#8220;yarb&ndash;doctors,&#8221;
who know more of the genuine properties of our native
plants than it is common to give them credit for.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Bollin and its little tributaries
grows also that curious plant, the butter&ndash;bur. Appearing
first as an egg&ndash;shaped purple bud, by degrees a beautiful
cone or pyramid of lilac blossoms is opened out, bearing
no slight resemblance to a hyacinth. Here, again, as
happens with many spring flowers, and, strange to say,
with two or three autumnal ones, the blossoms are ready
before the leaves, which do not attain their full size till
after midsummer. Then they hide the river&ndash;banks
everywhere about Manchester with a thick and deceitful
jungle, often lifted on stalks a yard high, and in their
vast circumference reminding one of rhubarb leaves.
After these earlier visitants come the furze, the purple
dead&ndash;nettle, and the primrose; and in the hedges, again
without leaves, the sloe or black&ndash;thorn, its milk&ndash;white
bloom conspicuous from a long distance. The name
<i>black</i>&ndash;thorn, so oddly at variance with the pure white of
the flowers, refers to the leaflessness of the plant when in
bloom, the <i>white</i>&ndash;thorn, or &#8220;May,&#8221; being at the corresponding
period covered with verdure. But it must not
be imagined that these plants follow just in the order we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
have named them. To a certain extent, no doubt there
is a sequence. Every one of the four seasons, whether
spring, summer, autumn, or winter, resembles the total
of the year as to the regularity in the order of its events.
The glowing apple and the juicy pear follow the lily and
the rose, and are followed in their turn, by the aster
and the ivy&ndash;bloom. Similarly, in smaller compass, the
crocus retires before the daffodil, and the daffodil before
the auricula; to expect, however, that every particular
kind of flower should open at some precise and undeviating
point of time, even relative, would be to look for
the very opposite of the delightful sportiveness so
characteristic of the ever&ndash;youthful life of nature, which is
as charming,&mdash;not to say as great and glorious, in its
play and freedom, as in its laws and inviolable order.
The spring flowers arrive, not in single file, but in troops
and companies, so that of these latter only can succession
be rightly predicated, and even here it is greatly affected
by differences of shelter, soil, and aspect. Nor are those
we have enumerated the whole of what may be found.
At least a dozen other species arrive with the earliest
breath of spring, and with every week afterwards, up to
midsummer, the beautiful stream quickens unabatingly.
Thoroughly to master the botany even of so limited an
area as that of Ashley, requires that it be made our
almost daily haunt. It is proper to add, that none of the
flowers named are rare about Manchester, or anywhere
in England. Almost all our first comers are universally
diffused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The phenomena of spring, as regards the vegetable
world, must not be viewed as <i>beginning</i> with the season
in question. Spring, while the harbinger and preparation
of the ensuing seasons, is itself the consummation of a
long series of wonderful processes, wrought in the silence
and darkness of winter, and largely beneath the surface
of the earth. We never see the actual beginning of anything.
Covered up though they be, by the cold snow,
the artizans of leaf and flower are diligently at work even
from the close of the preceding summer, and only wait
the vernal sunbeam to unfold the delicate product of
their labours. This is strikingly exemplified in &#8220;bulbous
roots,&#8221; such as those of the tulip and crocus, in which
the future flower may easily be made out by careful dissection
with a penknife. The hazel puts forth its infant
catkins as early as September, while the rich brown
clusters of the same season are but ripening, and the
autumn yellow of the leaves is in the distance. Soon
after this it is quite easy to find the incipient female
alder&ndash;bloom of the season to come, and the rudimentary
golden catkins of the next year&#8217;s sallow. Thus is the
history of the flower beautifully in keeping with that of
its winged image&mdash;the butterfly, which, like the flower in
the bud, has been forming all along, in the grub and
chrysalis, the bud&ndash;state of the perfect insect.</p>

<p>The river approaches the Ashley meadows by an
exceedingly pleasant route, generally known as the lower
Bollin valley. The whole course of the stream, from
beyond Macclesfield downwards, is interesting, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Norcliffe it begins to meander through the prettiest rural
scenery near Manchester. The gentle rise and fall of
the ground on either side, the plentiful and comely trees,
the innumerable windings and turnings that bring with
every successive field a new and pretty prospect, the
sound of the rushing water, the birds saturating every
grove and little wood with their cheerful poor man&#8217;s
music, the flowers no longer ambitious, for every bank
and meadow is brimful and overflowing,&mdash;really it almost
makes one fancy, when down in this beautiful valley, that
we have got into those happy regions old Homer tells of,
where the nepenthe grows, and the lotus,&mdash;that wonderful
fruit which, when people had once tasted, they forgot
their cares and troubles, and desired to remain there
always, and ceased to remember even home. The
difference is here, that after going thither, we love home
all the better for our visit, since the heart, though it may
be unconsciously, always grows into a resemblance of
what it contemplates with interest and affection. No
senseless fiction is it after all, about the lotus&ndash;fruit.
Every man has his lotus&ndash;country somewhere; the poet
has only turned into ingenious fable the experience of
universal human nature.</p>

<p>The middle portion of the valley, or that which,
ascending it, lies about half&ndash;way between Ashley and
Wilmslow, is occupied by Cotterill Clough, a place of the
highest celebrity with the old Lancashire botanists, being
not only picturesque in every portion, but containing
a great variety of curious and unusual wild&ndash;flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Many are found here that grow nowhere else in the
neighbourhood, and the very commonest attain the
highest state of perfection. Hobson, Crozier, Horsefield,
and their companions above&ndash;named, used to come to
Cotterill regularly, both in summer and winter, gathering
flowers in the former season, mosses in the latter,
and not more for the riches of the vegetation, than, as
Crozier once told me, for the singing of the innumerable
birds. The journey, both to and fro, was entirely
upon foot, and the men were often here by breakfast
time. Being a game preserve, there has always been
some difficulty of access to the clough, and of late years
this has been considerably increased. But gamekeepers,
after all, are only men, and &#8220;a soft answer turneth away
wrath,&#8221; so that none need despair if they will but act
the part of wisdom.</p>

<p>The approach to this pretty valley is made in the first
instance from Peel Causeway station, pursuing the lane
for a little while, then electing whether to continue, past
Bank Hall and its seventeen yew trees, or to strike
through a field&ndash;path upon the left, thence along the crest
of a gentle acclivity, from which is obtained the best
view we are acquainted with, of Bowdon. Although
requiring some watchfulness, so as not to go astray, the
upper path is decidedly the best to take. One point
alone needs specially careful observation, that is, after
crossing the little ravine, and emerging into another lane,
to turn down it to the right, and upon arriving at a
cottage upon the left, to take the path immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<i>behind</i>. This leads over the fields, Alderley Edge a few
miles in front, and Cloud&ndash;end rising grandly upon the
horizon, then down a steep rough lane into a dingle
called Butts Clough, beyond which there is a green&ndash;floored
lane, leading to Warburton&#8217;s farm, which being
passed, we bear to the right, and in ten minutes more
dip into the valley, and very soon tread the margin of the
stream. About a mile and a half further up, we come to
Castle Mill, an old&ndash;established and celebrated corn&ndash;grinding
concern&mdash;and immediately opposite, the wooded
slopes of Cotterill, entered by crossing a single field.
The time to select for a first botanical visit to this charming
spot should, if possible, be the end of April, or at
least before the expiration of May. The chief rarities of
the place belong to a somewhat later period, but there
are several that grow here abundantly, and are in perfection
at the time named, which, although less uncommon,
it were a pity not to secure. Such are the goldilocks
and the arum. The former, a very graceful kind of
butter&ndash;cup, its name translated from the Latin one,
<i>auricomus</i>, fringes the bank at the foot of the wood for a
long distance with its light feathery herbage and shining
yellow flowers; the other grows under the trees, and
among the brushwood, and in the part of the clough
through which the path leading to Ringway from Castle
Mill makes its way, thus being reachable without more
trespass than of twenty forgiven yards. Few persons
fond of cultivating plants in their parlours are unacquainted
with that truly splendid flower, the African lily, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<i>Richardia Ethiopica</i>, which, opening a great white vase
on the summit of its stem, resembles an alabaster lamp
with a pillar of flame burning in the centre; the leaves
lifted on long stalks, and shaped like the head of an
arrow. Keeping the figure of this noble plant before the
mind&#8217;s eye, as the type for comparison, there is no
difficulty in identifying the arum of Cotterill Wood. The
latter is essentially the same in structure, but rises to the
height of only some six or eight inches instead of thirty,
with leaves proportionately smaller, and the flower,
instead of white and vase&ndash;like, of a pale transparent
green &#40;though often mottled, like the leaves, with purple
stains&#41;, and curving over the pillar in the centre like the
cowl of a monk. The pillar is of a rich puce or claret
colour, and occasionally of a delicate light amber. In
the south of England, where the plant abounds, the dark
ones are called &#8220;lords,&#8221; and the amber&ndash;coloured, &#8220;ladies.&#8221;
Newbridge Hollow, the Ashley Woods, and several other
places about Bowdon, share the possession of this
remarkable plant, which is, without question, the most
eccentrically formed of any that grow wild in the British
Islands. It is found also near Pendlebury, at Barton,
Reddish, and several other places, but very scantily, a
circumstance worth notice, because illustrating so well
what the learned call botanical topography. The floras
of entire countries are often not more strongly marked by
the presence or absence of certain species than the portions
even of so limited an area as that of Manchester
half&ndash;holiday excursions. Here, too, grows in profusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the sylvan forget&ndash;me&ndash;not, the flowers of an azure that
seems sucked from heaven itself. People confound it
sometimes with the germander&ndash;speedwell, another lovely
flower of May and June. But the leaves of the speedwell
are oval instead of long and narrow, like those of
the forget&ndash;me&ndash;not; and the flowers are not only of quite
a different shade of blue, but composed of four distinct
pieces, the forget&ndash;me&ndash;not being five&ndash;lobed, and yellow in
the centre. The consummate distinction of the forget&ndash;me&ndash;not
is the mode in which the flowers expand, and
which, along with its unique and celestial tint, is the true
reason of its being used as the emblem of constancy.
Possibly enough, the pathetic legend of the knight and
the lady by the water&ndash;side may have had a fact for its
basis, but the flower was representative of constancy long
before the unlucky lover met his death. The world,
truly seen and understood, is but another showing forth
of human nature, an echo of its lord and master, reiterating
in its various and beautiful structures, colours, and
configurations, what in him are thoughts and passions,
and in the forget&ndash;me&ndash;not we have one of the foremost
witnesses. This is no loose and misty speculation; but
to the earnest student of nature who looks below the surface
of things, a determinate and palpable fact, the
source of the most fascinating pleasures that connect
themselves with the genuine knowledge of plants and
flowers, and of the objects of nature universally. The
peculiarity referred to consists principally in the curious
spiral stalk, and the store of secret buds, a new flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
opening fresh and fresh every day as the stalk uncoils. It
may be added, as furnishing another example of the
variety in the distribution of plants, that the forget&ndash;me&ndash;not,
like the arum, is wanting on the Prestwich side of
the town, while the sylvan horsetail, so abundant in Mere
Clough, is comparatively a stranger to the valley of the
Bollin. To young people who have the opportunity of
exploring the respective places, independently of the
large local knowledge they acquire, it is a most instructive
employment to note these phenomena, for they
are all more or less intimately connected with the
grandest and widest laws of physical geography&mdash;the
great, as we have shown before, represented in the little&mdash;and
no science will be found in after life more
thoroughly entertaining or more practically useful. Besides
these more choice and remarkable flowers, there are
in Cotterill Wood at this period anemones and bluebells
without end; while in the upper part, accessible by the
path before&ndash;mentioned, and which should on no account
be left unvisited, the firs and larches are at the acme of
their floral pride. The flowers of these trees, like those
of the hazel and alder, are some of them only male,
others only female. The female flowers in due time
become the seed&ndash;cones, announcing them from afar; the
male flowers likewise assume the cone form, but as soon
as the purpose of their being is accomplished, they wither
and drop off. In the larch, the females are of a delicate
pink, contrasting exquisitely with the tender green of the
young tufted leaves, and conspicuous from their large size,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the males being comparatively small, though noticeable
from their immense abundance. In the firs, on the other
hand, we are attracted rather by the male flowers, which
are of a beautiful reddish buff, and on the slightest blow
being given to the branch, shed clouds of their fertilising
dust.</p>

<p>The Cotterill portion of the Bollin valley, while the
primroses are in bloom, has no parallel in our district.
Certain distant places, no doubt, are equally rich in this
general favourite&mdash;the Isle of Wight, for instance, and
the same is said of the Isle of Man, but for Manchester
lovers of primroses, Cotterill is a very paradise. All the
woods and lanes are full, every bank and sheltered slope
is yellow with them, everywhere primroses, primroses,
primroses, great handfuls, and bunches, a score every
time we pluck, till wonder is exhausted and out of
breath, and primroses and nature seem to mean
the same thing. Such was the spectacle on the
8th of May&mdash;when this was written&mdash;the glow of bloom,
which lasts in the whole perhaps for a month, being
then at its height. On one occasion it was as early as
April 27th. We now come to 1882. So great has been
the havoc made by collectors of roots for gardens, and
for sale in the market&ndash;place, that except in forbidden
parts, and somewhat higher up the valley, the primrose
is now almost as scarce as at the time referred to it was
plentiful. Great havoc has also been wrought during the
last quarter of a century by the mattock of the farm&ndash;labourer,
which has likewise diminished very considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the ancient abundance of some of the less common
plants, where exposed, such as the goldilocks and the
forget&ndash;me&ndash;not, though higher up the valley, like the primroses,
these are still to be found in fair quantity. Never
mind: the anemones, the golden celandine, so glossy
and so sensitive, the cuckoo&ndash;flowers, the marsh&ndash;marigold,
and a score of others, are untouched, and will remain
untouched. There is something a great deal better
than simple possession of the rare and strange, and
that is the happy faculty of appreciation of the lovely
old and common,&mdash;a faculty that needs only culture to
become an inexhaustible mine of enjoyment. Every
man finds himself richer than he imagines when he puts
the real value upon what Providence has given him.</p>

<p>For the return, we may either mount the hill, and get
into the lanes which pass through Hale or Ringway, and
so to Altrincham; or we may follow the downward
course of the stream, by the path enjoyed in coming, as
far as Warburton&#8217;s farm, already mentioned. Arrived
here, for variety sake, the better course is not by the
tempting green lane, but through the fields below and to
the left, which are full of every kind of rural beauty, and
here and there gemmed with cowslips. Different paths
take us either past the river again, and so by way of Ashley
to Bowdon, or into the road that leads to the Downs.
The latter is the shortest, but the Ashley way is the
pleasanter. The distance in the whole is a trifle over
that by the road, or, omitting fractions, four miles. All
the way along the birds are in full trill; with this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
charm in the sound, that independently of the music, the
songs of birds are always songs of pleasure. <i>We</i> sing in
many moods, and for many purposes, but the birds only
when they are happy. No notes of birds have an undertone
of sadness in them. Beautiful, too, in the early
summer, is it to mark here the glow of the red horizontal
sunlight, as it lies softly amid the branches of the golden&ndash;budded
oak, and the milk&ndash;white blossoms of the tall wild
cherries. Oh! how thoughtless is it of people to let
themselves be scared away from Botany by its evil but
undeserved reputation for &#8220;hard names,&#8221; when, with a
tenth of the effort given to the study of chess or whist,
they might master everything needful, and enter intelligently
into this sweet and sacred Temple of Nature.</p>

<p>The interest of the Bollin valley is quite as great
to the entomologist as to the botanist. By the kindness
of my friend, Mr. Edleston, I am enabled here to add
the following list of the Lepidoptera, which will be read
with pleasure by every one acquainted with the exquisite
forms and patrician dresses of English butterflies.</p>

<p>&#8220;The meadows,&#8221; he tells me, &#8220;near the river Bollin,
from Bank Hall to Castle Mill, produce more diurnal
Lepidoptera than any other locality in the Manchester
district, as the following select list &#40;1858&#41; will suffice to
prove&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<p>The past twenty&ndash;five years, it is to be feared, have told
as heavily upon the Lepidoptera as upon the primroses
and the cowslips, the latter also now far between. The
birds, likewise, have greatly diminished in numbers,
partly in consequence of the extreme severity of the trio
of hard winters which commenced with that of 1878&ndash;9.
We have also to lament the death of Mr. Edleston.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE path to the Ashley meadows offers the
best point of departure also for far&ndash;famed
Rostherne, for although the distance is somewhat
less from the &#8220;Ashley&#8221; station, the old
route past Bowdon vicarage remains the
most enjoyable. Going behind it, through
a little plantation, we proceed, with many
curves, yet without perplexity, into the lane which
looks down upon the eastern extremity of the mere;
then, crossing the fields, into the immediate presence,
as rejoiced in at the margin of the graveyard of the
church, which last is without question one of the most
charmingly placed in England, and in its site excites no
wonder that it was chosen for the ancient Saxon consecration,
as declared in the primitive name, Rodestorne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
&#8220;the lake &#40;or tarn&#41; of the Holy Cross.&#8221; The peculiar
charm of Rostherne Mere, compared with most other
Cheshire waters of similar character, comes of its lying so
much in a hollow, after the manner of many of the most
delicious lakes of Westmoreland, Cumberland, and the
romantic parts of Scotland; the area of the surface being
at the same time so considerable that there is no
suggestion, as sometimes with smaller meres when lying
in hollows, of the gradual gathering there of the produce
of rain&ndash;torrents, or even of the outcome of natural springs.
At Rostherne one learns not only what calmness means,
and what a broken fringe of diverse trees can do for still
water. Contemplating it from the graveyard, we seem to
have a fragment of the scenery of our beautiful world as
it showed,&mdash;begging pardon of the geologists and the
evolutionists,&mdash;&#8220;When the morning&ndash;stars sang together,
and all the sons of God shouted for joy.&#8221; The depth of
the water is remarkable. About a third of the distance
across, from near the summer&ndash;house, it is over a hundred
feet, thus as nearly as possible two&ndash;thirds of the depth of
the English Channel at the Straits of Dover, where the
lead sinks lowest; and a third of what it is anywhere
between Dover and the Eddystone lighthouse, so that
our lovely Rostherne Mere may well assert its claim to be
of almost maritime profundity. The area of the surface
is one hundred and fifteen statute acres. In the church
there is a monument which it is worth all the journey to
see,&mdash;Westmacott&#8217;s sculptured marble in memory of
Miss Beatrix Egerton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Rostherne, in turn, is the pleasantest way of pedestrian
approach to Tatton Park, so liberally opened to visitors
by Lord Egerton, on compliance with certain rules.
Visitors bent on seeing Tatton only, should go part way
from Bowdon by vehicle; for here, as at Cotterill, we
want, as in a picture&ndash;gallery, every minute, and to let too
much time be consumed in mere travel is a mistake. To
make a too hasty and thoughtless use of our opportunities
of pleasure is in any case to throw away the half of them;
the pleasure of the country beyond all others requires a
calm and unhurried step, a free and unwistful mind and
eye, such as cannot possibly be if, by waste or extravagance,
we are &#8220;tied to time,&#8221;&mdash;only when, by a wise
economy of our resources in this respect, we liberate
ourselves from care about trains and timebills, do we
catch nature&#8217;s sweetest smiles. The boundary measurement
of this beautiful park is upwards of ten miles, and
of its two thousand one hundred and thirty&ndash;five acres no
fewer than four hundred are occupied by woods and
plantations, with seventy&ndash;nine acres of water. Here we
may stroll beneath green vaults of foliage, and be
reminded of the aisles of cathedrals. Here we may contemplate
the <i>viridis senectus</i> of glorious old oaks that
have watched the flow of generations. Here, in autumn,
we learn, from a thousand old foresters&mdash;from beech, and
chestnut, and elm&mdash;that brave men, though overtaken by
inclemencies there is no withstanding, still put a good
face upon their fallen fortunes, and, like C&aelig;sar, who
drew his purple around him, die royally; and at Christmas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
when the wind seems to mourn amid the denuded
boughs, here again we feel how grand is the contrasted
life of the great, green, shining, scarlet&ndash;beaded hollies
that in summer we took no note of. The gardens,
including conservatories and fernery, access to all of
which is likewise liberally permitted, are crowded with
objects of interest&mdash;one hardly knows whether inside
their gates, or outside, is the more delectable. The park
was up till quite recently, the play&ndash;ground of nearly a
thousand deer, and still &#40;1882&#41; contains many hundreds.
The sight of them is one of the pleasures of the return
walk to Knutsford, to which place Tatton Park more
especially pertains.</p>

<p>Knutsford, an admirable centre, is reached immediately,
by train. But it must not be overlooked
that there is a very pleasant field&ndash;way thereto from
Mobberley, and that the path to Mobberley itself, one of
the most ancient of the Cheshire villages, is always
interesting,&mdash;starting, that is to say, from Ashley station.
Every portion of it is quiet and enjoyable, and those who
love seclusion would scarcely find another so exactly
suited to their taste. Soon after entering the fields, the
path dives through a little dell threaded by the Birkin
&#40;an affluent of the Bollin&#41;, then goes on through lanes
which in May are decked plenteously with primroses.
The way, perhaps, is rather intricate,&mdash;so much the better
for the exercise of our sagacity. Let not the &#8220;day of
small things&#8221; be despised. The Birkin is one of the
little streams that in the great concourse called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Mersey does honour at last to the British Tyre. Drayton
notices it in the Poly&ndash;olbion &#40;1622&#41;&nbsp;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>From hence he getteth Goyte down from her Peakish spring,<br />
And Bollen, that along doth nimbler Birkin bring.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><br /></p></div>

<p>The church, as would be anticipated, presents much
that is interesting to the ecclesiologist. Near the chancel
stands the accustomed and here undilapidated old village
graveyard yew, emblem of immortality, life triumphing
over death, therefore so suitable,&mdash;this particular one at
Mobberley the largest and most symmetrical within a
circuit of many miles. Across the road, hard by, an ash&ndash;tree
presents a singularly fine example of the habit of
growth called &#8220;weeping,&#8221;&mdash;not the ordinary tent&ndash;form
seen upon lawns, but lofty, and composed chiefly of
graceful self&ndash;woven ringlets, a cupola of green tresses,
beautiful at all seasons, and supplying, before the leaves
are out, a capital hint to every one desirous of learning
trees&mdash;as they deserve to be learned. For to this end
trees must be contemplated almost every month in the
year, when leafless as well as leafy. A grand tree is like
a great poem&mdash;not a thing to be glanced at with a
thoughtless &#8220;I have read it,&#8221; but to be studied, and with
remembrance of what once happened on the summit of
mount Ida.</p>

<p>On the Cotterill side of Mobberley, or Alderley way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the country resembles that in the vicinity of Castle Mill,
consisting of gentle slopes and promontories, often
wooded, and at every turn presenting some new and
agreeable feature. The little dells and cloughs, each
with its stream of clear water scampering away to the
Bollin, are delicious. The botany of Cotterill is also
recapitulated in its best features; mosses of the choicest
kinds grow in profusion on every bank,&mdash;<i>Hypna</i>, with
large green feathery branches, like ferns in miniature;
<i>Jungermannias</i> also; and the noblest plants of the hart&#8217;s&ndash;tongue
fern that occur in the district. One of the dells
positively overflows with it, excepting, that is, where the
ground is not pre&ndash;occupied by the prickly shield&ndash;fern.
Burleyhurst Wood, close by, contains abundance of the
pretty green&ndash;flowered true&ndash;love, <i>Paris quadrifolia</i>, more
properly <i>trulove</i>, the name referring not to the sentiment
itself, but to the famous old four&ndash;fold symbol of engagement
which in heraldry reappears in &#8220;quartering.&#8221; All
the spring flowers open here with the first steps of the
renewed season; and most inspiring is it, at a time when
on the north side of the town there is nothing to be seen
but an early coltsfoot, to find one&#8217;s self greeted in these
sweet and perennially green woods, by the primrose, the
anemone, the butter&ndash;bur, and the golden saxifrage,&mdash;and
not as single couriers, but plentiful as the delight they
give, mingling with the great ferns bequeathed by the
autumn, as travellers tell us palms and fir&ndash;trees intermix
on tropical mountains, while the <i>Marchantia</i> adds
another charm in its curious cones, and the smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
round cups of the <i>Peziza</i> glow like so many vases of
deepest carnelian. In the aspect of vegetation in early
spring, as it discloses itself at Mobberley and at equal
distance north of the town, there is the difference of a
full month. Such at least was the case in 1858, the year
in which these lines were written. There is no occasion
to return to Ashley by the same path. Mobberley station
is scarcely more than a mile from the village, and of
course would be preferred when the object is to reach
the latter promptly.</p>

<p>Knutsford, celebrated as the scene of Mrs. Gaskell&#8217;s
&#8220;Cranford,&#8221; commands many pleasant walks, and is the
threshold not only to Tatton, but to several other parks
and estates of great celebrity. Booth Hall, with its
noble avenue of lindens, the winding sylvan wilderness
called Spring Wood, and its ample sheet of ornamental
water, decked with lilies, and in parts filled with that
most curious aquatic, the <i>Stratiotes</i>, is of considerable
historic interest;&mdash;Toft, a mile to the south, with its
stately avenue, now of elms, in triple rows;&mdash;and Tabley,
about a mile to the west, the park once again with a
spacious mere, also have high claims upon the attention
of every one who has the opportunity of entering.
Tabley is peculiarly interesting in its ancient hall, which
stands upon an island in the upper portion of the mere,
and dates from the time of Edward III. Only a remnant
now exists, but being covered with ivy, it presents a most
picturesque appearance. When will people see in that
peerless evergreen not a foe, but an inestimable friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
such as it is when knives and shears, and the touch of
the barbarian are forbidden? It is the ivy that has preserved
for the arch&aelig;ologist many of the most precious
architectural relics our country possesses. Where ivy
defends the surface, nothing corrodes or breaks away.</p>

<p>Toft Park gives very agreeable access to Peover,&mdash;a
place which may also be reached pleasantly from Plumbley,
the station next succeeding Knutsford. Not &#8220;rich&#8221;
botanically, the field&ndash;path is still one of the most inviting
in the district. The views on either side, cheerful at all
seasons, are peculiarly so in spring, when the trees are
pouring their new green leaves into the sunshine, and the
rising grass and mingled wild&ndash;flowers flood the ground
with living brightness. In parts, towards the end of
May, there is hereabouts an unwonted profusion of
Shakspeare&#8217;s &#8220;Lady&ndash;smock.&#8221; We admit, admiringly,
that it &#8220;paints the meadows with delight:&#8221;&mdash;to the first
impression, when gathered and in the hand, it scarcely
seems &#8220;silver&ndash;white.&#8221; A single spray in the hand is
unquestionably <i>lilac</i>, faint and translucent, but still lilac,
exquisitely veined. Beware. Shakspeare, when he talks
of flowers may always be trusted. At all events his only
error is that curious one in <i>Cymbeline</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Viewed from a
little distance, and obliquely, the effect of a plentiful carpet
of this lovely wild&ndash;flower is distinctly and decidedly &#8220;silver&ndash;white.&#8221;
In all things a good deal depends upon the angle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
at which we look, and never is the rule more needed
than when the subject is one of delicate tint. They were
keen observers, depend upon it, who in the Middle
Ages gave name and fame at the same moment to the
pretty flowers that still preserve the ancient association
with &#8220;Our Lady,&#8221; the Virgin Mary. Lower Peover
church is one of the few examples extant of the old&ndash;fashioned
timber structure, the greater portion of the
interior being constructed of oak, while externally,
excepting the stone Elizabethan tower, it is &#8220;magpie,&#8221;
or black and white, like so many of the old Cheshire
halls and ancient manor&ndash;houses. An epitaph in the
graveyard is not without suggestiveness:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">
Peaceable Mary Fairbrother,<br />

<p>For the return walk there is a cheerful route through
fields and lanes to Knutsford, entering the town behind
the prison; or, for variety, there is Lostock Gralam
station.</p>

<p>Pushing a few miles further, we find ourselves at
Northwich, a place at which there is little occasion to
delay, unless it be wished to inspect one of the salt mines,
permission to do so being asked previously of the
proprietors. At Whitsuntide the public are in a certain
sense invited, and truly, a more interesting and wonderful
spectacle than is furnished by the Marston mine it would
be hard to provide for holiday pleasure. But at present
we are seeking enjoyment upon the surface, and to this
end the journey should now be continued to Hartford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the station for Vale Royal. &#8220;Vale Royal&#8221; is essentially
the name of the immense expanse of beautiful, though
nearly level, country over which the eye ranges when we
stand amid the ruins of Beeston Castle. It is still worthy
of the praise lavished on it in 1656. &#8220;The ayre of Vale
Royall,&#8221; says the old historian of that date, &#8220;is verie
wholesome, insomuch that the people of the country are
seldom infected with Disease or Sicknesse, neither do
they use the help of Physicians, nothing so much, as in
other countries. For when any of them are sick, they
make him a posset, and tye a kerchief on his head; and
if that will not amend him, then God be mercifull to him!
The people there live to be very old: some are Grandfathers,
their fathers yet living, and some are Grandfathers
before they be married.... They be very gentle and
courteous, ready to help and further one another; in
Religion very zealous, howbeit somewhat addicted to
Superstition: otherwise stout, bold, and hardy: withal
impatient of wrong, and ready to resist the Enemy or
Stranger that shall invade their country.... Likewise
be the women very friendly and loving, in all kind of
Housewifery expert, fruitful in bearing Children after
they be married, and sometimes before.... I know
divers men which are but farmers that may compare
therein with a Lord or Baron in some Countreys beyond
the Seas.&#8221;&mdash;A considerable portion of this great expanse
is represented in the still current appellation of Delamere
Forest,&mdash;a term not to be understood as meaning that it
was at any time covered by timber&ndash;trees, either indigenous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
or planted, but that it was &#8220;outside,&#8221; <i>ad foras</i>, a wild,
uncultivated and comparatively barren tract as opposed
to districts that were well farmed and sprinkled plentifully
with habitations. Trees there were, doubtless, and in
abundance, but the <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> woods occupied only a part
of the &#8220;forest&#8221; in the aggregate. An idea of such a
forest as Delamere was in the olden time is very easily
formed. We need do no more than think of that
imperishable one, &#8220;exempt from public haunt,&#8221; where
Rosalind found her verses, with its stream&ndash;side where the</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p><span class="add4em">Poor sequester&#8217;d stag,</span><br />
That from the hunter&#8217;s aim had ta&#8217;en a hurt<br />
Did come to languish.</p></div>

<p>The &#8220;forest,&#8221; so late as two centuries ago, comprised no
fewer than eleven thousand acres of wood and wilderness.
Much has now been brought under cultivation, so that
only about eight thousand acres remain untilled, and of
these about one&ndash;half have been planted with Scotch fir,
whence the peculiar and solemn aspect which masses of
conifers alone can bestow.</p>

<p>Entering this part of the &#8220;Vale,&#8221; we are at once
attracted to the beautiful park, woods, and waters, distinguished
particularly as &#8220;Vale Royal,&#8221; or in full, Vale
Royal Abbey, the mansion,&mdash;the ancient country seat
of the Cholmondeley family&mdash;being nearly upon the site
of the famous monastic home founded in 1277 by
Edward I. Lord Delamere liberally permits access to
the grounds, the approaches to which are eminently
sweet and pleasant. The railway should be quitted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Hartford, quiet lanes from which place lead into the
valley of the Weaver.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Thence we move to the margin
of Vale Royal Mere, with choice, upon arrival, of one of
the most charming sylvan walks in Cheshire, obtained by
going through the wood, or a more open path along the
opposite shore. To take one path going, the other returning,
and thus to secure the double harvest, of course
is best. So, for the final homeward journey, which should
not be by way of Hartford, but <i>vi&acirc;</i> Cuddington. A
drive through the glorious fir&ndash;plantations which abut upon
Vale Royal carries the privileged to another most
beautiful scene,&mdash;Oulton Park, the country seat of the
Grey&ndash;Egertons. Here again is a sheet of lilied water;
here, too, are some of the noblest trees in Cheshire, including
one of the most remarkable lindens the world
contains.</p>

<p>For the visitor to Delamere Forest there is after all no
scene more inspiring than is furnished by Eddisbury.
Cuddington station will do for this, but the walk is rather
too long; it is best to go direct to &#8220;Delamere,&#8221; thence
along the road a short distance, and so to the foot of the
hill. In the time of the Heptarchy, it was an important
stronghold. Rising to the height of five hundred and
eighty&ndash;four feet above the sea, when in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 914 that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
admirable lady, Ethelfleda, daughter of Alfred, and
widow of Ethelred, king of Mercia, sought to establish
herself in positions of great strength, her feminine
sagacity at once pointed to Eddisbury as impregnable.
Ethelfleda, says the old chronicler, was &#8220;the wisest lady in
England, an heroic princess; she might have been called
a king rather than a lady or a queen. King Edward,
her brother, governed his life, in his best actions, by her
counsels.&#8221; We have admirable women of our own living
among us&mdash;women in every sense queenly by nature:&mdash;let
us never forget, in our gratitude to God for the gift of
them, that in the past there were prototypes of the best.
Continued in her rule, by acclamation, after the death of
her husband, Ethelfleda, &#8220;the lady of the Mercians,&#8221;
reigned for eight years. Rather more than eleven acres
of the green mound we are now speaking of were
defensively enclosed by her, partly with palings, partly with
earthworks, traces of which remain to this day. Frail
and perishable in its materials, the &#8220;city of Eddisbury,&#8221;
as historians call this once glorious though simple settlement,
in the very nature of things could not last. A
good river, essential to the prosperity of an inland town,
it did not possess. After the death, moreover, of Ethelfleda,
who went to her rest in 920, the subsidence of the
Danish invasions reduced the importance of such fortresses,
and so, by slow degrees, the famous old &#8220;city&#8221;
disappeared. The name of Eddisbury occurs, it is true,
in Domesday Book, but apparently as a name and
nothing besides. Places like Eddisbury are to England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
what the sites of Nineveh and Palmyra are to the world.
Standing upon their greensward, the memory of great
things and greater people passes before the mind in long
and animating procession. The once so great and
powerful &#8220;Queen of the East,&#8221; proud, chaste, literary
Zenobia, was not nobler in her way than Saxon Ethelfleda.
Thinking of her, pleasant it is to note how the
little wild&ndash;flowers, the milk&ndash;wort and the eyebright, the
unchanged heritors of the ground, are virtually just as
she left them. Upon these, in such a spot, Time lays no
&#8220;effacing finger.&#8221; &#8220;States fall, arts fade, but Nature
doth not die.&#8221; Not without interest, either, is the fact
that from the name of the people or kingdom she ruled
so well, comes that of our chief local river. The Mersey
was the dividing line between Mercia and Northumbria,
and of the former it preserves memorable tradition. All
the way up the stream till we get to the hill country, the
topographical names further illustrate the ancient Saxon
presence. The view from storied Eddisbury is of course
very extensive and delightful, including, to&ndash;day, the
venerable Cathedral of Chester, Halton Castle, and the
broad bosom of the river, not to mention the boundless
champaign to the south and east, and afar off, in the
quiet west, grey mountains that seem to lean against the
sky.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Delamere Hotel,&#8221; to which all visitors to these
regions very naturally bend their steps, is the place to
enquire at for the exact way to the borders of Oakmere;
most pleasing, after Rostherne, of the Cheshire waters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
For here, in the autumnal sunshine, the soft wind is
prone so to waft over the dimpling surface that it
becomes covered with lucid ripples, while at the margin,
if the &#8220;crimson weeds&#8221; of the mermaids&#8217; country are not
present, there are pretty green ones that &#8220;lie like
pictures on the sands below,&#8221;</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>With all those bright&ndash;hued pebbles that the sun<br />
Through the small waves so softly shines upon.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">The borders of Oakmere abound with curious plants.
One of the rarest of British grasses, the <i>Calamagrostis
stricta</i>, grows here. The locality is also a noted one for
the <i>Utricularia minor</i>, though we do not find that
interesting fern of the Vale Royal wood, the <i>Lastrea
Thelypteris</i>.</p>

<p>Contemplating this lovely mere, whether from Eddisbury,
or its own borders, and remembering the many
similar waters close by,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> a group, after that one to which
Windermere leads the way, without parallel in our island,
it is impossible not to feel curious as to their history.
The simple fact appears to be that all, or nearly all the
Vale Royal meres are referable to the existence, underneath,
of great salt crystal beds which give occupation
to the people of Northwich. The surface&ndash;soil of the
Cheshire salt district consists of a few feet of drift&ndash;sand
or clay. Below this there is a considerable depth of
&#8220;New red marl,&#8221; and below this there is good reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
believe there is a nearly continuous bed or deposit of the
crystal. The &#8220;new red sandstone&#8221; rock in which these
deposits are embedded, is very porous and much jointed.
Water is constantly filtering into them from above; the
salt crystal, exposed to its action, slowly dissolves into
brine, which, as the height is at least a hundred feet
above the sea&ndash;level, slowly drains away. Then the overlying
strata gradually sink; depressions are caused, of
less or greater magnitude, and in course of time these
become basins of water. Mr. Edw. Hull, the distinguished
geologist, considers that should the process go
on, the whole of the valley of the Weaver will some day
be submerged. Most of the salt sent from Cheshire is
prepared from this natural brine. To extract the crystal
is not so cheap as to let the water do the mining, then to
pump up the solution, and evaporate it.</p>

<small>CARRINGTON MOSS.</small></h2>

<div class="poem10">
<p>&#8220;Will you walk into my parlour?&#8221; said the spider to the fly:<br />
&#8220;&#8217;Tis the prettiest little parlour that ever you did spy.&#8221;</p></div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHOULD any of our unknown companions in
these rambles be vegetarians, they will please
here take notice that Carrington Moss is
in the summer&ndash;time a scene of ravenous
slaughter such as cannot but be exceedingly
painful and shocking to them. It will
appear the more repulsive from the high
character for innocence ordinarily borne by the destroyers,
who are the last beings in the world we should expect to
find indulging in personal cruelty, much less acting the
part of perfidious sirens. Having given this warning,
our friends will of course have only themselves to blame
should they persist in following us to the spectacle we
are about to describe; and now it only remains to say
that the perpetrators of the deeds alluded to are <i>plants</i>!
People are apt to look upon plants simply as things that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
just grow up quietly and inoffensively, open their flowers,
love the rain, in due time ripen their seeds, then
wither and depart, leaving no more to be recorded of
their life and actions than comes of the brief span of the
little babe that melts unweaned from its mother&#8217;s arms.
This is quite to mistake their nature. So far from being
uniform, and unmarked by anything active, the lives of
plants are full from beginning to end of the most curious
and diversified phenomena. Not that they act knowingly,
exercising consciousness and volition,&mdash;this has
been the dream only of a few enthusiasts,&mdash;but taking
one plant with another, the history of vegetable life is
quite a romance, and scarcely inferior in wonderful circumstance
to that of animals. So close is the general
resemblance of plants to animals, as regards the vital
processes and phenomena, that it would be difficult, if
not impossible, to point out a single fact in connection
with the one that has not a counterpart, more or less
exact, among the other. The animal world is a repetition
in finer workmanship of the vegetable. As for
harmlessness and inoffensiveness in plants, these are the
very last qualities to be ascribed to them. Pleasant are
fragrant flowers, and sweet fruits, and wholesome herbs,
but these tell only half the tale. No wild beast of the
forest rends with sharper teeth than grow on thorn&ndash;trees
of different kinds; if the wasp darts its poisoned sting
into our flesh, so does the nettle; if snakes&#8217; bites be
mortal, so is the venomous juice of the deadly nightshade.
Not in the least surprising is it, then, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
should find certain plants indicating a propensity to prey.
Animals of lower degree as regards every other disposition
of life, why should they not participate in this one?
That they do so is plain. Though as a rule, plants
feed upon watery and gaseous matters, supplied by the
earth and atmosphere, the members of at least two curious
tribes, the <i>Sarracenias</i>, and the <i>Droserace&aelig;</i> or &#8220;Sundews,&#8221;
depend not alone on solutions of manure, or other long&ndash;since&ndash;decayed
organic substances, prepared by chemical
action, but collect fresh animal food on their own behalf.
The latter include the plants that may be seen engaged
in their predatory work upon Carrington Moss.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the consideration of them, we
may take the opportunity, furnished by this long word
<i>Droserace&aelig;</i>, of saying a little about the &#8220;hard names&#8221; so
often charged upon botanical science. It is continually
asked what need is there to call flowers by those excruciating
Latin titles. Why cannot they have plain English
names? Why must all our names be</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p><span class="add4em">Like the verbum Gr&aelig;cum,</span><br />
Spermagoraiolekitholakapolides,<br />
Words that should only be said upon holidays,<br />
When one has nothing else to do?</p></div>

<p>Many make it a ground of abstaining from the study
of botany altogether, that the names are so hard to learn,
as if every other science and species of knowledge,
including history and geography, were not equally full of
hard words. But look now at the simple truth of the
matter. Very many of the common or &#8220;English&#8221; names
of flowers are in reality their botanical or Latin ones, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
fuchsia, laburnum, camellia, geranium, iris, verbena,
rhododendron, so that it is not a question of language
after all. To be consistent, these names should be left
to the professional man, and &#8220;English&#8221; ones be manufactured
in their place; it is clear, however, that they can
quite easily be learned and spoken, Latin though they
are, and if some can be mastered and found simple
enough, of course others can. Besides, what would it
advantage us to substitute really English names for them?
Nothing would be gained except a synonym, by saying,
as we might, &#8220;crimson&ndash;drop&#8221; instead of fuchsia, or
&#8220;golden&ndash;rain&#8221; instead of laburnum; while very much
would be lost in precision by using a name of obscure
and uncertain origin, and upon which even one&#8217;s own
neighbours might not be agreed, instead of a term fixed
by the great leaders in the science of botany, whose
judgment all respect, and which is accepted by every
nation of the civilised world. It is quite as necessary to
call plants by determinate scientific names as to call a
certain constellation Orion, and a certain island Spitzbergen.
Botanists do not call plants by Latin names
simply out of pedantry, or to make their science difficult,
but for the sake of clearness and uniformity. None of the
botanical names are so hard as it is fancied; the Lancashire
botanists in humble life have no trouble with them;
the real difficulty is in not caring anything about the objects
they are applied to. We do not find those who make
so much outcry about the Latin names particularly anxious
to learn the English ones either. The English names are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
not thrown overboard by their Latin companions. All
true botanists, so far from rejecting or despising English
names, love them and continually use them, substituting
the Latin synonyms only when scientific accuracy requires.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to the sundews, first describing
the way to their habitation. All the mosses about
Manchester possess these curious plants, but Carrington
Moss is the most readily accessible, lying only a little
distance south&ndash;west of Sale. From the station we go for
about a mile in the direction of Ashton&ndash;upon&ndash;Mersey,
then turn up one of the lanes upon the left, and look out
for a grove of dark fir&ndash;trees, which, being close upon the
borders of the moss, is an excellent guide. The edge of
the moss is being drained and brought under cultivation;
all this part, along with the ditches, must be crossed, and
the higher, undisturbed portion ascended, and as soon
as we are up here we find the objects of our search.
Among the heather are numberless little marshes, filled
with pea&ndash;green <i>Sphagnum</i>, and containing often a
score or two of the sundews, some of them with round
leaves, about a third of an inch across, and growing
in flat rosettes of half&ndash;a&ndash;dozen; others, with long and
slender leaves that grow erect. Every leaf is set round
with bright red hairs, which spread from it like eyelashes,
while similar but shorter hairs cover the surface. When
the plant is full&ndash;grown and healthy, these hairs exude
from their points little drops of sticky and limpid fluid,
which, glittering like the diamonds of Aurora, show
the reason of the poetical English name, sundew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Directly that any little fly or midge comes in contact with
the sticky drops, the unfortunate creature is taken captive,
just as birds are caught with bird&ndash;lime. Held fast in its
jewelled trap, the poor prisoner soon expires; and then,
either its juices or the gaseous products of the decomposition,
appear to be absorbed by the plant, and thus
to constitute a portion of its diet. This is rendered the
more probable by the experiments of the late Mr. Joseph
Knight, of Chelsea, who fed the large American flycatcher,
the <i>Dion&aelig;a</i>, with fibres of raw beef, and found
the plant all the better for its good dinners. Certainly it
cannot be asserted positively that the Drosera is nourished
by its animal prey, but it is difficult to imagine that so
extraordinary and successful an apparatus is given to
these plants for the mere purpose of destroying midges,
and that the higher purpose of food is not the primary
one. On the larger leaves may generally be seen relics
of the repast, shrivelled bodies, wings, and legs, reminding
one of the picked bones that strew the entrance to the
giant&#8217;s cavern in the fairy tale. Sundew plants may be
kept in a parlour, by planting them in a dishful of green
moss, which must be constantly flooded with water, and
covering the whole with a glass shade. Exposed to the
sunshine, their glittering drops come out abundantly, but
the redness of the hairs diminishes sensibly, owing,
perhaps, to their being denied their natural prey. The
flowers of these singular plants are white, and borne on
slender stalks that rise to the height of three or four
inches. The roots survive the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Carrington Moss is further remarkable for the profuse
growth of that beautiful flower, the Lancashire asphodel,
which, at the end of July and the beginning of August,
lights it up with flambeaux of bright yellow. Here also
grow the <i>Rhyncospora alba</i>, the cranberry, the Andromeda,
and the cotton&ndash;sedge, all in great abundance; and on the
margin, among the ditches, luxuriant grasses peculiar to
moorland, and the finest specimens of the purple heather
that are anywhere to be seen so near Manchester.
The rich sunset&ndash;like lustre of this sturdy but graceful
plant renders it one of the loveliest ornaments of our
country when summer begins to wane into autumn.
Branches, gathered when in full bloom, and laid to dry in
the shade, retain their freshness of form and pretty colour
for many months, and serve very pleasingly to mix with
honesty and everlastings for the winter decoration of the
chimneypiece. Intermixed with the heather grows the
<i>Erica tetralix</i>, or blushing&ndash;maiden heath, an exceedingly
elegant species, with light pink flowers, collected in dense
clusters at the very summit of the stalk. The immediate
borders of the moss, and the lanes approaching it, are
prolific in curious plants. To go no further, indeed,
quite repays a visit. July is the best time. Then the
foxgloves lift their magnificent crimson spires, and the
purple&ndash;tufted vetch trails its light foliage and delicate
clusters beneath the woodbines; and the tall bright
lotus in coronets of gold, and the meadow&ndash;sweet, smelling
like hawthorn, make the lady&ndash;fern look its greenest, while
in the fields alongside stands, in all its pride of yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and violet, the great parti&ndash;coloured dead&ndash;nettle, which
here grows in luxuriant perfection. Up to the very end
of autumn this district is quite a garden to the practical
botanist. Where cultivated and uncultivated land adjoin,
just as where land and sea come in contact, there is
always found the largest variety and plenty, alike of
vegetable and of animal life; and nowhere is this more
marked than on the borders of Carrington Moss. The
cottages near the moss are but few. Tea may be procured
nevertheless, if we are content to run the risk of
there being no milk, which, like fish by the sea&ndash;side, is
often a scarce thing even in the heart of the country;
but on a pleasant summer evening, when everything else
is fair and contenting, he must be a grumbler indeed who
would let <i>this</i> spoil his enjoyment. Half a loaf enjoyed
with one&#8217;s friends, far away in the sweet silence of nature,
and a happy walk home afterwards, with loving faces right
and left, is better, ten times over, than a luxurious meal
got by coming away prematurely. All this part of the
country is remarkable also for the luxuriance of its culinary
vegetables. The rhubarb is some of the finest
grown near Manchester, and it is quite a treat to look at
the beans.</p>

<p>Another way to the moss, available for residents at
Bowdon, is through Oldfield, and by Seaman&#8217;s Moss
Bridge, where we cross the Warrington railway, to
Sinderland, looking out when thus far for a lane upon the
right, bordered first by birch&ndash;trees and afterwards by
oaks. All these lanes, like those on the Ashton side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the moss, are remarkably rich in wild&ndash;flowers and ferns,
the latter including the royal fern, or Osmunda, and in
early summer show great plenty of the white lychnis,
called, from not opening its petals till evening, the
<i>vespertina</i>. The pink&ndash;flowered lychnis, the &#8220;brid&ndash;e&#8217;en&#8221;
or &#8220;bird&#8217;s eye&#8221; of the country people, is, like the telegraph
office, &#8220;open always.&#8221; Here we may perceive the use of
Latin or botanical names; for &#8220;bird&#8217;s eye&#8221; is applied to
many different plants in different parts of England, so
that a botanist at a distance who might chance to read
these lines could not possibly tell what flower was meant,
whereas, in &#8220;Lychnis vespertina&#8221; there is certainty for all.
Whoever is fond of blackberries and wild raspberries
would do well to make acquaintance with these pretty
lanes; whoever, too, is fond of solitude&mdash;a state not fit
for all, nor for any man too prolongedly, but a true friend
to those who can use it. If we would thoroughly enjoy
life, we should never overlook the value of occasional
solitude. It is one of the four things which we should
get a little of, if possible, every day of our lives, namely,
reading, good music, sport with little children, and utter
seclusion from the busy world.</p>

<p>The number of mosses and moors in the neighbourhood
of Manchester makes it interesting&mdash;as in the case
of the Cheshire meres, to know something of their origin.
The wonderful discoveries of geology, with regard to the
crust of the earth, and the successive deposition of the
strata of which it is composed, claim our attention
scarcely more than the history of the surface, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
undergone changes quite as momentous to the welfare of
man, and no part of that history is more curious, perhaps,
than that of the mosses. Wherever a moss now extends
in wet and dreary waste, it would seem that there was
once a plain or expanse of tolerably dry land, more or
less plentifully covered with trees and underwood, but
subject, by reason of the depressed level, to frequent
inundation, just as we see the fields at Sale and Stretford
flooded every now and then at the present day. The falling
of the older and weaker trees, in consequence of the
long&ndash;continued wetness, and the want of a steady and complete
outlet for the accumulated waters, would soon cause
the place to assume the character of a marsh,&mdash;neither
land nor lake,&mdash;and now semi&ndash;amphibious plants would
not be slow to spring up, for wherever such conditions of
surface are exchanged for dry ones, plants of that nature
appear as if by magic. The morass thus formed and
occupied, would in a single season become knee&ndash;deep in
the very same kind of mixture as that which now forms
the outer skin of Carrington Moss, viz., heather of
different kinds, cotton&ndash;sedges, and bog&ndash;moss. Every
successive year the original mass of roots and stems
would be left deeper and deeper beneath by the new and
upward growth of the vegetation above; till at last,
saturated with wet, and pressed by the weight of the
superincumbent matter, it would acquire the compact
form which is now called &#8220;peat.&#8221; The original moisture
of the place, instead of diminishing, would be incessantly
reinforced from the clouds, and the lapse of a few centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
would pile up on the surface of the once dry ground,
a heap many yards in vertical thickness of half&ndash;decayed,
half&ndash;living heath and moss, with sundews, cotton&ndash;sedges,
and asphodels on the top. The branches of the trees
drowned and entombed at the beginning, would remain
where they fell, slowly decaying, but retaining their
character well enough to be recognised, and hence
wherever a moss is now drained, and portions of the
original deposit are dug out, there are generally found
mixed with it branches and fragments that in a
measure may be likened to fossils. Carrington Moss, in
parts where drained, is strewed with such bits of the
silver birch, declared by the shining whiteness of the
bark. The trees that these bits belonged to no doubt
grew tall and leafy on the spot that is now their
sepulchre and memorial. Flowers and seeds of bog
plants are also found low down in the moss, almost as
fresh as if newly fallen. In the middle, these vast
vegetable tumuli are often twenty or thirty feet deep.
In any part a walking&ndash;stick may be plunged in for its full
length, and though by stepping and standing on the
denser tufts of heather, it is quite easy to walk about
dry&ndash;shod, it is quite as easy by uncarefulness, especially
after wet weather, to be in a pool of water up to the
ankle in a few minutes. There is no <i>danger</i> in walking
upon the mosses, merely this little risk of getting wet&ndash;footed,
which is more than compensated by the curious
objects that may be found upon them. In winter and
dull weather they are desolate enough, but on a summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
afternoon full of reward. Owing to their immense
capacity for absorption, many mosses swell into mounds
higher than the surrounding country, as happens at Carrington;
and after heavy rains this enlargement is so
much increased that distant objects are concealed from
view until evaporation and drainage have caused subsidence
to the ordinary level. Before Ashton Moss
&#40;between Droylsden and Ashton&ndash;under&ndash;Lyne&#41; was drained,
trees and houses were often lost to view for many days,
by persons residing on the opposite side.</p>

<p>That this is the true origin of the mosses is rendered
fairly certain by the circumstance of works of human art
having often been found at the bottom. When Ashton
Moss was drained, there were found under the peat a
Celtic axe and some Roman coins;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and in another part,
at the foot of one of the old stumps of trees, a quantity of
charred wood, betokening that a fire had once been
lighted there. The coins would naturally suggest that
some old Roman soldier had had a hand in the kindling,
and the well&ndash;known fact of the extensive felling of
trees by the Romans, both in road&ndash;making, and to aid
them in the subjugation of the country, has led to the
belief with some, that to these people may partially be
attributed the origination of the mosses. The trees and
scattered branches encumbering the ground, are supposed
to have checked the free passage of floods and other
water, which, becoming stagnated, gradually destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the growing timber, and eventually led to the results described
above. Baines &#40;History of Lancashire, iii. 131&#41;
says of Chat Moss, that it was originally the site of an
immense forest, but was reduced to a bog by the Roman
invaders, at a period coeval with the first promulgation
of the Christian religion. It would probably be no error
to assert with Whitaker, that the whole of the country
round Manchester, and not merely the site of Chat
Moss, was, at the time of the Romans, covered with
trees. One thing is quite certain, namely, that the formation
of the mosses is comparatively recent, and probably
much within one thousand eight hundred years. They
appear to rest universally on a clayey substratum, and it
is very interesting to observe that where the peat is wholly
removed, for the purpose of fuel, as upon Holford Moss,
near Toft and Peover, the clay surface being then laid
bare, birch&ndash;trees spring up unsown. The seeds of these
trees must have been lying there since they ripened,
unable to vegetate previously for want of air and the
solar warmth. It is quite a familiar phenomenon for
plants to spring up in this way from seeds that have been
buried for ages, especially on earth laid bare by cuttings
for railways and similar works; so in truth it is no more
than would be expected in connection with the clearing
away of peat, and the restoration of the under&ndash;surface.
The tree next in frequency to the birch, as a denizen of
the old <i>silva</i>, appears to have been the oak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moors&#8221; are a more consolidated form of mosses.
Seated, most usually, on higher and more easily drained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
ground than the mosses, they have in some cases
preserved a drier nature from the first; in others, they
have become drier in the course of time, through the
escape of their moisture by runnels to lower levels; and
in others again, they have allowed of easy artificial draining,
and conversion to purposes of pasturage and tillage,
or at least over a considerable portion of their surface,
and have thus disappeared into farm&ndash;land. The most
extensive and celebrated mosses about Manchester, still
undrained, are Chat Moss, Carrington Moss, and Clifton
Moss, near the Clifton railway station, on the left hand of
the Bolton&ndash;road. Fifteen years ago &#40;<i>i.e.</i> in 1843&#41;, White
Moss and Ashton Moss might have been included in the
list, but both of these are now largely brought under
cultivation. The most celebrated moors are now nearly
all under the power of the plough, as Baguley Moor and
Sale Moor, while Newton Heath is covered with houses.</p>

<p>The above chapter was written in 1858. The story of
the sundews has now become an old familiar one, having
been placed prominently before the world by Dr. Hooker
during the 1874 meeting of the British Association, when
the novelty of the theme attracted universal attention to
it. It has been dealt with also by Mr. Darwin and many
of his disciples. The facts described have all been
verified, though there is still considerable difference of
opinion in regard to the digestive process. This question
is one we cannot pretend to go further into at present;
it remains for the rising generation of Manchester, and
other local physiologists, to recognise the value of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
opportunities they possess in having the plants themselves
so close at hand. Upon Carrington, however, the
Droseras seem to be less plentiful than they were forty
years ago. The draining at the margins appears to have
favoured the growth of the heather, as well as to have
rendered the moss less swampy. If deficient here, there
are plenty elsewhere, the sundews being to peat&ndash;bogs
what daisies are to the meadows. Since 1858 the
approaches to the moss from the Manchester side have
also been a good deal altered, and enquiry must now be
made of residents in the neighbourhood when seeking
the most convenient means of access.</p>

<p>Extending so far in the direction of Dunham, the
wooded slopes of which latter are plainly visible from
all parts, wet Carrington,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>Water, water, everywhere,<br />
And not a drop to drink,&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">excites new relish for the shades of its beautiful park.
Few are the inhabitants of our town to whom Dunham
is unknown, and who fail upon every new visit to find in
it a poem and a jubilee. The greater number of the
trees were planted by George, second Earl of Warrington.
He was born in 1675, and died in 1758, so that his
exemplary work may be considered to date from the time,
as to its beginning, of Queen Anne, and the oldest of the
trees to have been growing for nearly two centuries,
since, of course, it would not be acorns that were placed
in the soil, but saplings, already stout and hearty.
Wandering amid the rich glooms they now afford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
occasional breaks and interspaces disclosing green
hollows filled with sunlight, or crested knolls that seem
like sanctuaries; delicate pencillings of lighter foliage
throwing into grand relief the darker and heavier masses,
in this sweet land there is never any sense of sameness,&mdash;we
are awakened rather to the power there is in perfect
sylvan scenery, as well as in that of the mountains, and
the sea&ndash;margin, to elevate and refresh one&#8217;s entire spiritual
nature. Very pleasant is it when we can simultaneously
thank God for creating noble trees, and let the mind rest
upon a fellow&ndash;creature as the immediate donor. Many
of the old Dunham oaks date considerably further back
than the time indicated. England is dotted all over with
individual trees, the age of which is rightfully estimated
by centuries, and Dunham Park is not without its
reverend share.</p>

<p>Emerging from the park, past the old mill&mdash;beloved
of sketching artists&mdash;there are pleasant footways across
the meadows that conduct eventually to Lymm. To
trace them was, in the bygones, a never&ndash;failing enjoyment.
Now we go to Lymm direct by train, finding there, as
of old, one of the most beautiful of the Cheshire waters;
in this case, however, of origin very different from the
Vale Royal meres. The water at Lymm, romantic and
picturesque as are its surroundings, is simply a vast
reservoir, brought into existence by the construction of
the viaduct at the foot. The site now occupied by the
water was originally a little vale, down which flowed a
streamlet called the Dane. Becoming very narrow where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the roadway now is, to throw a barricade across was easy.
The construction of this gave distinctiveness also to the
&#8220;dell,&#8221; the pretty hollow, full of trees, into which, when
the water is high, the overplus, creeping under the road
by a concealed channel, springs so cheerily. Ordinarily,
it must be confessed, there is little more than a thin
trickle, but after a day or two&#8217;s heavy rain, down it
comes, with a joyous double leap, in great sheaves and
waving veils, the more delectable since the cascade in
question is the only one in this part of Cheshire, or
anywhere upon the Cheshire side of the town.</p>

<p>The pleasantest time to visit this beautiful neighbourhood
is the very end of July. The wild cherries are
then ripe, and glisten like coral amid the green leaves;
and in the water there is a rosy archipelago of persicaria
blossom. Beyond the plantation, at the upper extremity,
the surface is often so still and placid that every flower
and leaf upon the banks finds its image beneath, the
inverted foxgloves changing, as the calm gives way to
ripples, into softly twining spirals of crimson light.
When the shores are laid unusually bare through drought,
they furnish abundance of the beautiful shells of the
fresh&ndash;water mussel, <i>Anodonta cygnea</i>, often four inches in
length, externally olive&ndash;green, and possessed inside of
the pearly iridescence so much admired in sea&ndash;shells.
Many, however, are broken, the swans being fond of the
contents. To see the water to its full extent, visitors
should continue along the hill&ndash;side, opposite the church,
and as far as the grove of trees. With permission of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
proprietor, it is a great gain, on arrival there, to cross
by the rustic bridge, and, turning to the left, ascend the
little valley called &#8220;Ridding&#8217;s Brook.&#8221; The botany of
this part is truly rich,&mdash;in March the slopes are yellow
with the wild daffodil, and in late summer the bank is
gay with purple lythrum. The special interest of the
valley lies, after all, in its curious dropping and petrifying
spring. At the further extremity, upon the right, the
steep clay bank, instead of receding, is hollowed
underneath for the length of a hundred yards or so, the
upper edge projecting to a considerable distance beyond
the base, so as to overhang the stream, and form a
sloping roof to it. The surface is completely covered
with luxuriant moss, and from the land overhead comes
an incessant filter of water, which at once nourishing the
moss and entangled in it, causes it to hang down in long
vegetable ringlets. At a distance they seem soft, but
examination shows that every drop has brought along
with it a particle of earth, which being deposited in the
very substance of the moss, is gradually converting it
into stone. Every cluster, externally so green and living,
is in its heart a petrifaction.</p>

</div>

<p>Very pleasant walks, of entirely different character,
are to be found also, when at Lymm, along the great
alluvial flat bordered by the river, and which reaches to
Thelwall. Thelwall was once a port for ships! When
founded by Edward the elder, about the year 923, the
stream was so much wider and deeper that, according to
tradition, the Danish invaders came this way in vessels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
landed, and established a camp or fortress at Mickley
Hill, the mound, now covered with fir&ndash;trees, which marks
the point where the Bollin enters. Up to about 1855,
or before the water was so defiled, the Mersey at this
part, and more particularly near Statham, was to the
sportsman supremely attractive. It was visited in the
winter by many curious birds, including the sheldrake,
the widgeon, the teal, and occasionally the wild swan.
Lymm village contains several objects of arch&aelig;ological
interest. Near the centre are the remains of an ancient
cross, the lower steps of which are cut out of the
solid rock; and close by, upon an eminence, is Lymm
Hall, an ancient building, once, like most others of its
kind, protected by a moat. Lymm church tower is as
high above the sea&ndash;level at the base as Bowdon old
tower is at the top. The shrubs in the gardens, owing to
the altitude, are often reached, in tempestuous weather,
by the salt of the Irish Sea. Near Lymm there are many
other very interesting places. Oughtrington Hall and
Agden Hall, in the Dunham direction; High Legh, with
its ancient and beautiful little church, covered with ivy;
and Warburton, again noted for its church, are all, in their
respective ways, full of attraction. Warburton church is
one of the three in Cheshire which, as at Peover, were
built in the quaint old &#8220;black and white&#8221; or &#8220;magpie&#8221;
style. Only a portion, however, of the original remains
at Warburton, new structures, very odd in complexion,
having been added at various times. The stone part is
dated 1645,&mdash;the tower, about a century old, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fortunately now ivy&ndash;mantled, is of <i>brick</i>! The yews are
no doubt contemporaneous with the foundation, say
about seven hundred years of age.</p>

<p>Latchford, the station next beyond Thelwall, is a good
point of departure for Hill Cliff, the lofty and beautiful
eminence upon which Warrington so prides itself. The
view from the summit is considered by many the most
varied and extensive in Cheshire&mdash;justly so, perhaps,
since upon the east it extends to Alderley, and upon the
west to Moel Famma. Another route to Hill Cliff is by
the original line to Warrington, through Eccles, from
Victoria station, the same which leads on to Norton for
Norton Priory, Norton Park, and Halton Castle; to
Frodsham, for its glorious hills, and to Chester. The
views from the Frodsham hills cover, like those from
Hill Cliff, a most charming variety of scene,&mdash;Halton
Castle, Weston Point, Rock Savage, the Aston Woods,
and the winding Weaver, with its many craft, being all
embraced at once. The best way of procedure, in order
to enjoy the hills thoroughly, is to take the Helsby
portion first, beginning at the station of that name, then
to cross the valley and ascend the Overton part. If considered
too much for a single day, there is amply enough
for a couple of separate visits. Norton Park, made up
of undulating and flowery glades, with the Priory in the
centre, is little less enjoyable than Tatton, though the
spectacle of the dire mischief wrought by the fumes
from the adjacent alkali&ndash;works, apparently irreparable, is
very sad; Halton Castle has its chief attraction in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
record, for the precincts, of well&ndash;known historical events;
the interest of the river consists in its identification with
one of the most important branches of the local commerce.
Before going so far in search of enjoyment, it is
wise to remember that long before reaching even Lymm,
the line <i>vi&acirc;</i> Broadheath gives access to quiet fields that in
summer evenings are rich in pleasant influence, those in
particular which lie west of Dunham Massey. A very
delightful rural neighbourhood, almost contiguous, has
also now been opened up by the &#8220;Cheshire Midland.&#8221;
Urmston, Flixton, and Glazebrook are centres from which
it is difficult to move unprofitably. Very much of course
depends upon the amount of disposition to be pleased
that we carry with us, and upon one&#8217;s progress in the
culture of that finest of the fine arts&mdash;the art of seeing.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is not a more delightful ride out of
town, at any season of the year, than through
Rusholme and Didsbury to Cheadle. The
country is on either hand fertile and
pleasantly wooded, and in many places
embellished with handsome grounds, while
gardens and shrubberies succeed one another
so fast that the road seems completely edged with them.
The variety of trees presented to view is greater than
upon any other road out of Manchester. In the five
miles between Ducie&ndash;street and Abney Hall, we have
counted upwards of forty different species, some of them
by no means frequent in these parts, while others are
uncommonly fine examples of their kind. The finest
sycamore, and, after the great horse&ndash;chestnut between
Singleton and Besses&ndash;o&#8217;&ndash;th&#8217;&ndash;Barn, perhaps the finest tree
of any sort near Manchester, as regards either symmetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
or altitude, stands upon the lawn of Mr. T. H. Nevill&#8217;s
house at Didsbury, the second on the Manchester side
of the College. Oak, willow, elm, poplar in three
different kinds, lime, ash, and beech, both green and
purple, are also represented very fairly. There are
examples, too, of walnut, of negundo, and of tulip trees.
A noble specimen of the last&ndash;named stood not far from
the Didsbury sycamore until about 1855, and was covered
with flowers every season; but, like the cedar in the
grounds adjoining Mr. Callender&#8217;s late residence at
Rusholme, which was another of the finest trees on the
road, fell a victim about that time to the axe of
&#8220;improvement.&#8221; Each was a cruel case of what Miss
Mitford well calls &#8220;tree murder.&#8221; Such trees cannot be
replaced in less than three generations; the sycamore at
Mr. Nevill&#8217;s is already over a hundred years old; so near
to Manchester, it will probably be impossible ever to see
the like of them again; let us hope, then, that what remain
will be cherished. Cut them down when they become
ruinous, if you will,&mdash;though nothing makes a more
beautiful ornament of true pleasure&ndash;grounds than the
torso of an ancient tree from which the living glory has
departed,&mdash;but spare them as long as vigorous life
endures. So numerous are the lilacs, laburnums, chestnuts,
thorns, both white and red, and other gay&ndash;blossomed
contributors to this charming arboretum, that from the
end of May till the middle of June the road is one long
flower&ndash;show. Before these commence their gala, there
are the apple and pear trees; earlier yet the silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
birches, covered with their pendent catkins; and in the
autumn we seem to have flowers over again in the scarlet
berries of the holly and mountain ash.</p>

<p>Not only is the road beautiful in itself, but to residents upon the
Greenheys and Chorlton side of the town, the opportunities which
it provides of access to scenes of rural beauty are peculiarly
advantageous. Stretford way, there is nothing worth mention till we
reach Dunham. There are plenty of quiet lanes, it is true, and the
farm&ndash;land is well cultivated; but in landscape, the whole of the great
plain intersected by the Bowdon Railway is totally and admittedly
deficient. With Didsbury, on the other hand, we enter a country fit
for a Linnell. We may turn down by the church to the river&ndash;side, and
follow the stream through pleasant fields to Northen; or we may push
forward another mile, cross the Mersey at Cheadle Bridge, and strike
into a scene of such singular and romantic beauty, and so thoroughly
unique in its composition, that we know of nothing in the neighbourhood
to liken it to. This is the place called &#8220;Gatley Carrs.&#8221; It is easily
found. Immediately the bridge is crossed, take the broad path through
the meadow on the right, and look out for the chimney of Mr. Jowett&#8217;s
corn&ndash;mill. Go through the mill&ndash;yard, and over the brook, then through
another field or two into a lane red with refuse from a tile&ndash;croft, and
in a little while there will be seen, again upon the right, a cluster
of cottages and barns. These surround a bit of sward called &#8220;Gatley
Green,&#8221; which must be traversed, and after a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> yards further
walk by a runnel of water, we have the Carrs straight before us. The
term &#8220;Carr&#8221; is of Gothic derivation, and denotes an expanse of level
land, near a river, covered with alders or other water&ndash;loving trees.
Such is the character of the scene here. An extensive and verdant
plain, smooth and level as a bowling&ndash;green, stretches from our feet
away to some undiscoverable boundary, its further portion covered with
tall poplars, entirely bare of branches for half their height, and
leafy only towards their summit, the trunks standing just near enough
together to form a grove of pillared foliage, and just far enough apart
for every tree to be seen in its integrity, and for the sunshine to
penetrate and illuminate every nook. They are not the kind of poplar
commonly understood by the name&mdash;the slender, spire&ndash;like tree, which is
quite exceptional even among poplars&mdash;but one of the species with ample
and spreading crowns. The number of trees is immense&mdash;at a rough guess,
perhaps a thousand. They were planted by the late Mr. Worthington,
of Sharston Hall; the timber, though almost useless to the joiner,
being well adapted for cutting into the thin, narrow strips called
&#8220;swords,&#8221; upon which it is customary to fold silks. The path commanding
this beautiful view runs along the upper margin of the plain. It is
somewhat elevated above the grass, and keeps company with a stream, the
opposite bank of which rises still higher, and is covered with oaks
and ferns. The superiority of position thus afforded, though trifling,
gives to the plain the aspect of a vast amphitheatre, and so calm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
delicious is the whole scene, so tranquil and consecrated the look of
the untrodden wood, that it seems surely one of the sacred groves of
the Druids, and one can hardly think but that presently we shall see
the priests enter in grand procession, in their white robes and ancient
beards, and carrying the golden knife that is to sever the misletoe
bough. In the evening there come effects of yet rarer charm, for then
the declining sun casts long interlineations of shadow across the
level, and lights up every leaf from underneath.</p>

<p>The botany of the Carrs corresponds in extent with
that of Mobberley, though in many respects quite
different. The greatest curiosity, perhaps, is the toothwort,
or <i>Lathr&aelig;a</i>, that singular plant which, disliking the
solar ray, lives recluse in woods and groves, often half&ndash;concealed
in dead tree&ndash;leaves, and scarcely lifting its
cadaverous bloom above the surface. Here also grows
the <i>Poa nemoralis</i>. The meads yield occasional specimens
of a pretty rose&ndash;coloured variety of the creeping bugle,
and are so rich in wild&ndash;flowers in general as to form,
along with the woods beside the stream, quite a natural
botanic garden. The further part of the wood, towards
Sharston, is, no doubt, the abode of many plants of
interest, and only wants searching out. The reputation
of a given locality for rare plants comes not infrequently
of some one of ardour having gone to work upon it;
innumerable places, were they thoroughly explored,
would rise from unimportance into fame. Happily, as
regards Gatley Carrs, Mr. Edward Stone, son of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
able and well&ndash;known chemist, whose collection, both of
indigenous and exotic plants, in his garden at Cheadle,
has done so much good service to the cause of botany,
is devoting himself to the task.</p>

<p>The stream above&ndash;mentioned curves, after a little
while, to the right, and the path changes to the opposite
side. It is at this point that the extent of the wood is
developed, and that we turn to go homewards. If time
permit, it is well to continue awhile along the middle
path in front, and visit first the Upper Carrs, which, as
seen from the terrace that runs all the way from Cheadle
to Baguley, are remarkably beautiful. The wood, as here
disclosed, is full of invitation, and where the branches
stand asunder, we see great prairies, the green grass
all a&ndash;glow with red sorrel blossom, and dotted with
islands of radiant white, where that giant of field flowers,
the great moon&ndash;daisy, shows its pride. This noble
ornament of our meadow&ndash;land, called on the other side
of the Tweed the &#8220;horse&ndash;gowan,&#8221; is one of the class of
flowers called &#8220;compound,&#8221; being made up of some
hundreds of &#8220;florets&#8221; or miniature flowers, enclosed in
a kind of basket. An average specimen has been
found to contain five hundred and sixty, and a fine
one no fewer than eight hundred. The florets are
disposed in exquisite curving lines, exactly resembling
the back of an engine&ndash;turned watch. What has the
ingenuity of man ever devised that has not its prototype
somewhere in nature? The chalice holding this
remarkable flower is of the most elegant construction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and in form like an acorn&ndash;cup. Moving on by the brookside,
after crossing it at the bridge, we soon enter a
spacious meadow upon the left, and find ourselves again
in sight of the Mersey. On the bank of the stream, just
before quitting it, may be seen the wild red&ndash;currant,
making, with its neighbours, the wild raspberry and the
wood strawberry, a show of native fruits without parallel
in this neighbourhood. The meadow is of exuberant
fertility, owing to the annual flood from the river.
Leaving it, we come next to a rising ground, planted
with white willows, and from this emerge into a lane,
and so over the brow of the hill to Northen churchyard.
Northen, of course, becomes a resting&ndash;place, and a very
pleasant one it is. Both church and churchyard deserve
examination. The former contains a neat monument
to the memory of Mr. Worthington, the planter of the
poplars in the Carrs, and another with an epitaph
attributed to the pen of Alexander Pope.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Several
pretty memorials of the dead occur likewise among the
tombstones outside. On one fragment there is seemingly
written with green moss, the graving in the stone being
entirely filled up with the plant&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem10"><p>ANNE&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;DOVG<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">On another are the following pretty lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem10"><p>
The cup of life just with her lips she pressed,<br />
Found the taste bitter, and declined the rest;<br />
Averse then turning from the face of day,<br />
She softly sighed her little soul away.</p></div>

<p>From Northen to Manchester the ways are many.
One is to walk two miles and a half along the lanes to
Sale Moor station; a second, to follow the southern
bank of the river to Jackson&#8217;s boat; a third, is to cross
the fields into the Cheadle road, and catch the townwards
omnibus, a distance of less than a mile; and the last, to
our own mind much the pleasantest&mdash;first along the
northern bank for about a mile, and then across the fields
towards Platt and Rusholme. The commencement of
the last&ndash;named is exceedingly delightful, the water flowing
on the left, woods and pastures upon the right, in
the evening sweetly enlivened by the cuckoo. Nothing
in the year&#8217;s round of pleasure is more heart&ndash;soothing
than an hour in these quiet fields immediately after
sunset, while it is too light for the stars, but the planets
peer forth in their beautiful lustre, and the darkness
quickens our ears to the slightest sound. The nightingale
alone is wanting to complete the effect, but we have no
nightingales near Manchester. There is nothing for
them to eat, and they stay away. The bird sometimes
mistaken for the nightingale, from its singing at the same
hours, and running through a variety of notes, is the
sedge&ndash;warbler.</p>

<p>Enjoying this sweet neighbourhood in early summer,
and while it is yet broad day, one can hardly fail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
notice the tribe of <i>grasses</i>, at least up to the time of
haymaking. No fewer than sixty&ndash;three different kinds
may be collected about Manchester, and fully a third of
these in the meadows. The remainder are inhabitants
of the woods and ponds, while a few grow exclusively
upon the moors. Attaining their perfection in May and
June, easily collected, and not withering on the way
home, the grasses are the very best plants to begin with
in forming a collection of dried flowers. We have
spoken before of the pleasure that attends this pursuit:
the utility, to any one who takes the slightest interest in
nature, is quite upon a par. How pleasant at Christmas
to turn over the pages of one&#8217;s <i>Hortus Siccus</i>, freshening
our remembrance alike of the beautiful and diversified
shapes of the plants, and of the days and scenes where
they were gathered! A more interesting or instructive
pursuit for a young person, of either sex, than to set
about collecting specimens of the grasses, ferns, and
wild&ndash;flowers in general, that they meet with in their
country walks, is in truth scarcely to be found. The
attraction it gives to the country is prodigious, and surely
it is more sensible when out in the fields thus to employ
one&#8217;s self than to wander along listlessly for want of an
object, and perhaps get into mischief. The method
to pursue is exceedingly simple. First get together a
quantity of old newspapers, and fold them to about
eighteen inches square. Then buy a few quires of
Bentall&#8217;s botanical drying paper, and procure also three
or four pieces of stout millboard. Such is the apparatus;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
nothing more is wanted; and next we must gather our
specimens, selecting, to begin with, such as are of slender
make and comparatively juiceless texture. Pieces of
about a foot long are large enough, but if the plant be
less than ten or twelve inches in height, it should be
taken root and all. Having the boards and papers in
readiness, lay one of the former as a foundation, and to
serve as a tray; upon this place a folded newspaper, and
upon this a sheet of Bentall, and then the specimen
intended to be dried. Over the specimen should come
a second sheet of Bentall, then another newspaper, and
so on till the whole collecting is deposited. All being
in order, it remains only to place a heavy weight
upon the top of the pile, so as to press the plants flat,
and prevent the air entering to shrivel them. The
easiest weights to use are common red bricks, but, as
bricks look untidy in a parlour, and are unpleasant to
handle in their naked state, they should be tied up neatly
and separately in smooth brown paper, and then not the
most fastidious or weak&ndash;fingered can object to them. In
this condition the pile should be left till the next day,
when it should be turned over, layer by layer, and the
specimens transferred into dry Bentall. The newspapers
need not be changed unless the plants are succulent
ones, and their moisture has penetrated. The weight
should then be replaced, and the pile again be left to
itself for three or four days, when the specimens will be
found perfectly dry, their forms scarcely altered, and
their colours, except in special cases, almost as bright as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
when growing. For very delicate plants, instead of
Bentall, it is best to use sheets of clean white cotton&ndash;wadding,
with tissue paper, to prevent the specimens
clinging to the cotton when of adhesive nature. When
quite deprived of their juices, the specimens should
be transferred into sheets of white paper, and neatly
fastened down, not with gum arabic, which is apt to
smear and look untidy, but with a solution of caoutchouc
in naphtha, sold in the shops under the name of
&#8220;indiarubber cement.&#8221; The great advantage of this is
that if any should exude from below the specimen, it
may, when dry, be rubbed off like a pencil mark. The
name of the plant, and the date and place where
gathered, should be written underneath. Giving a
summer to the work, it is surprising how soon a large
and beautiful collection of plants will accumulate, and
how rapidly we feel ourselves progressing in botanical
knowledge. Taking ordinary care, there is no reason
why plants should not look nearly as green and pretty
when dried as when living. If an herbarium be only a
heap of Latin hay, as sometimes happens, it is not that
the art of preserving plants is deceptive, but that the
collector has been clumsy or neglectful. Nor are dried
plants, as some esteem them, mere vegetable mummies,
wretched corpses devoid of all instructiveness or value,
for they are far more lively than drawings, and answer
all our questions with readiness. Many good botanists,
it is true, have done without such collections, showing
that they are by no means indispensable to the study of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
botany. But none who have taken the trouble to form
them ever regret it, while all confess their inestimable
service. Even if the herbarium served no scientific
purpose whatever, there is always the pleasure of finding
in it a garden all the year round.</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>Here spring perpetual leads the laughing hours,<br />
And winter wears a wreath of summer flowers.</p></div>

<p><i>Vi&acirc;</i> Northen is the pleasantest route to the beautiful
district of which the centre is Wythenshawe Hall, a
remarkably fine building of the time of James the First,
and at present the seat of Mr. Thomas Wm. Tatton. It
is approached through a piece of ground called the &#8220;Saxfield,&#8221;
upon which tradition says there was once a terrible
fight between Saxons and Danes; old maps mark the
place with crossed swords. We have not much of
historical interest pertaining to the neighbourhood of
Manchester, but what there is seems to concentrate
about Northen. The Pretender, Prince Charles Edward,
crossed the river in 1745, at a place not very far below
Cheadle Bridge, and it is curious that the Prince
Consort&#8217;s visit, in 1857, when he came to open the
Art&ndash;Treasures Exhibition at Old Trafford, should have
been made by way of the very bridge alluded to. In
1644 Wythenshawe was besieged by a party of Cromwell&#8217;s
soldiers, who planted a battery on the side overlooking
Northen, and threw many cannon&ndash;shots against the
house. During some alterations in the garden a
few years since, and the conversion of a pond&ndash;bottom
into flower&ndash;beds, several of the balls were found; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
another, which entered by the drawing&ndash;room window,
and smashed the wood&ndash;carving on the opposite wall, is
shown to visitors privileged to view this beautiful hall.
The carving was not replaced, so that the blank space
preserves a distinct memorial of the attack. The siege
was conducted by the celebrated Colonel Robert Dukenfield,
the most conspicuous soldier, after Sir William
Brereton, in the Cheshire history of the Civil War. It
occupied some time, and was only brought to a close by
getting two pieces of ordnance from Manchester, the
same probably from which the balls above alluded to
were discharged. During its progress, one of the maid&ndash;servants
inside, for her amusement, took aim with a
musket at an officer of the Parliamentary forces, who was
carelessly lounging about, and managed to kill him. He is
supposed to have been the &#8220;Captayne Adams,&#8221; stated in
the Stockport register of burials to have been &#8220;slayne at
Withenshawe, on Sunday, the 25th.&#8221; In the course of
alterations in the grounds during the last century, six
skeletons were discovered. They were lying close together,
and are reasonably supposed to have been those of soldiers
who perished during the siege. Cromwell afterwards
stayed at the hall, and slept in a room still called, from
his occupation of it, &#8220;Oliver Cromwell&#8217;s room.&#8221; The
bed, which is dated 1619, is of elegantly carved wood,
the furniture and mirrors matching it, and of the same
age. The wood&ndash;carving at Lyme Hall is usually considered
to show the best local work of the period, but
that at Wythenshawe, in the opinion of many, is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
finer. The gardens surrounding the hall are full of
curious trees, many of them remarkably good and shapely
specimens, especially an <i>Arbor vit&aelig;</i>, consisting of a tall
green pyramid, surrounded by minarets, like a spire
with pinnacles round the base, and exquisitely beautiful
when swayed slopingly by the wind. In 1858 there
sprang up in a piece of newly&ndash;turned land at the back
of the hall, many hundreds of the <i>Rumex sanguineus</i>,
its large oval light&ndash;green leaves traced and pencilled in
every direction with the richest crimson. The ordinary
green&ndash;juiced form of the plant is common enough, but
the crimson&ndash;juiced is one of the rarities of our Flora.</p>

<p>Further again, for those who care for rural pleasures
and the legacies of the past, there is the interesting
district of Baguley and its old hall. Only one large
apartment of the latter remains, the greater portion of the
structure having, at some remote period, been destroyed
by fire; the buildings which surround and prop up the
ancient piece are comparatively new. Baguley Old Hall
is well worth a visit, and may be reached, if more convenient
to excursionists, by way of Sale Moor station,
and a walk of two or three miles along the lanes. In
the interior, it will be observed that the doorways are
formed of oaken boughs that were curved at one
extremity, so that when sliced and reared on end, with
the curved portions directed one towards the other, they
would form arches. These arches are exceedingly
curious, and, along with the numerous armorial bearings,
form quite a noticeable feature of the place. A walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
across a few fields leads to Baguley Mill. The lanes are
full of fragrant roses; the high hedges shelter innumerable
veronicas; and by the sides of the little water&ndash;courses,
close to the mill, grows abundance of the hart&#8217;s&ndash;tongue fern.
To attempt the whole in the space of a single afternoon,
of course is not practicable, especially if one is verging
towards that inexorable period of life when gravitation
begins to get the better of a man sooner than he has
been accustomed to; nor is it intended to recommend
so much. Gatley Carrs suffice for one walk; the immediate
neighbourhood of Northen and the river&ndash;banks
provide another; and Baguley <i>vi&acirc;</i> Sale will pleasantly
supply objects for a third. There is a fourth, moreover,
well commenced at Didsbury, but keeping in the direction
of Chorlton&ndash;cum&ndash;Hardy, so as eventually to reach Barlow
Hall, the local residence of Mr. William Cunliffe Brooks.
The arch&aelig;ological interest of Barlow Hall we have not
room here to enlarge upon. It must suffice to invite
attention to Mr. Letherbrow&#8217;s beautiful etching of the
best fragment in preservation, the period of which is
believed to be that of the reign of Henry VIII., when
the hall was occupied by the very ancient and historical
family of de Barlow, allied by marriage to the still more
celebrated Stanleys, as shown by the heraldry of the
window.</p>

</div>

<p>No chapter of the original little volume of 1858 calls
for so many obituary notices, now in 1882, as this one
descriptive of Gatley Carrs. The magnificent, not to say
unique, Didsbury sycamore was cut down a year or two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
after the publication. The great horse&ndash;chestnut, near
Singleton has disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Mr. Callender died in 1872.
Mr. Stone, sen., is also &#8220;with the majority,&#8221; and the Carrs
themselves no longer deserve the ancient appellation,
having been crossed by a railway embankment. A good
deal remains no doubt that is pretty and pleasing, but the
picture drawn above exists no longer. That a locality
once so beautiful should have been thus rudely dealt
with is unfortunate, few will deny. But nothing that
contributes to the prosperity of a great nation, or to the
public welfare, is at any time to be deplored. Such
changes simply illustrate anew the prim&aelig;val law that
great purposes shall always demand some kind of
sacrifice.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE the opening of the &#8220;Manchester and
Birmingham&#8221;&mdash;a title now forgotten, the line
having been absorbed into the London and
North&ndash;Western&mdash;the road through Rusholme,
Didsbury, and Cheadle was the accustomed
highway to Congleton, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Wilmslow, to
which latter place the hand still points at certain corners
within a mile or two of All Saints&#8217; Church. The
Cheadle people occasionally made use of it for pic&ndash;nic
carriage parties to a fir&ndash;crowned steep just beyond
Chorley, a wilderness scarcely inhabited, and, save for
its checking the speed of travellers from Knutsford to
Macclesfield, scarcely recognized in the local geography.
How vast the revolution promoted in 1842! The wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
soon became decked with mansions and gardens; it
blossomed as the rose; and &#8220;Alderley Edge&#8221; is now
little less than a suburb of Manchester.</p>

<p>The old carriage&ndash;way being superseded by the rail,
and much that is delightful being reached by train long
before getting to Alderley, we will now accordingly make
new departure for fair Cheshire by way of Stockport.
Arrived at Wilmslow the old&ndash;fashioned, the Bollin reappears,
this particular point being in truth the head of
the valley through which the stream, as before&ndash;mentioned,
pursues its sinuous and rapid course to Ashley. The
country upon the right is full of quiet lanes and pretty
meadows, none of which are more pleasing than those
containing the path to the margin of Norcliffe. If
permission can be obtained to visit the glen <i>ipsissima</i>,
they are like the vestibule of a temple. Norcliffe was
laid out in 1830 by the late Mr. R. H. Greg. Selecting
everything that he planted with consummate taste and
judgment, the slopes are rich with trees which in point of
value and variety have no equal in this part of England.
Beautiful from the first, the scene at the present moment
is more charming than ever before; for tree&ndash;planting is
one of those essentially noble and generous works the
glory of which a man can rarely expect to see unfolded
in his own life&ndash;time:&mdash;like a great poem, it reaches afar,
and covers the generations that succeed. The very
striking feature of Norcliffe, the main and characteristic
one, consists in the profusion of the Conifers. The
pine, the fir, the cedar, in their many and always princely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
forms, are represented in this delicious spot by upwards
of forty species and varieties, many of them having very
numerous examples, all presenting, in the best manner,
the symmetrical outlines so remarkable in coniferous
trees, and holding positions with regard to their immediate
neighbours such as awaken the most agreeable ideas
of harmony. There is no taller Deodara in the neighbourhood
than one of the specimens near the lawn, nor
is there anywhere in this neighbourhood a more comely
Norway spruce, the top already seventy feet above the
turf, and covered annually with cones, which the squirrels
are glad of, the spring never finding one that the little
creatures have overlooked.</p>

<p>Norcliffe is equally remarkable in respect of its rhododendrons,
the purple splendour, early in June, tossed up
like a floral surf. These last, being like the conifers,
evergreens, Norcliffe, if nothing else, is a place of
perennial verdure. Almost, as on the banks of old
Clitumnus&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">Hic ver assiduum, atque alienis mensibus &aelig;stas!</p>

<p>The walk through the sylvan part of the glen, tortuous,
and rarely on level ground, brings many beautiful wild&ndash;flowers
into view. Here, in the month of May, is the
wood&ndash;millet&mdash;lightest and daintiest, after the Briza, of our
native grasses&mdash;and yet more plentifully the sweet woodruff,
holding up in every corner its little handfuls of
snow&ndash;white crosses. Access to Norcliffe,&mdash;the grounds
being strictly and in every portion private,&mdash;is, of course,
only by favour. But the honoured name of Greg has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
always been a synonym for liberality, and leave to enter
when properly sought is not likely to be refused. The
same may be said of the picturesque and delightful
grounds, a mile further down the valley, which appertain
to Oversley Lodge, the residence of Mr. Arthur Greg.
The treat here is the wilderness&ndash;walk, a portion of which
was cut only in 1881, along the side of the principal cliff.
During the progress of the clearing a new locality was
found for the true&ndash;love.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> So certain is the reward, not
only in important shape, but in little and unexpected
ways, of every man who first makes a path through the
forest, whether with the axe or with the more subtle
tools that are not wrought upon human forges. Spring
is the time, above all others, if it can be managed, for
these beautiful Oversley woods; for then we have the
opening green leaves in a thousand artistic forms, and in
endless shades; the violets also, and the satin&ndash;flower;
and, full of promise, the so&ndash;comfortably&ndash;wrapped&ndash;up ferns
that in September will show how nature revels in transformations.
The Oversley woods abut very closely upon
Cotterill, approaching which place there is scenery not
inferior in its modest and singular sweetness to that of
the vicinity of Castle Mill. The public approach is from
Wilmslow, treading first the western margin of Lindow
Common, then going through various lanes, and in
front of &#8220;Dooley&#8217;s farm.&#8221; The greensward portion
of the country now soon entered is generally distinguished
by the name of the Morley Meadows, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
sylvan part by the somewhat odd title of &#8220;Hanging&ndash;banks
Wood.&#8221; The phrase is designed, it would seem, to
convey an idea analogous to that involved in the name
of the famous &#8220;Hanging&ndash;gardens&#8221; of ancient Babylon,
signifying terraces of wood and blossom disposed in
parallel order upon some gentle slope. This is the part
of the Bollin valley referred to in an early chapter <a href="#Page_27">&#40;p. 27&#41;</a>
as the asylum, it is to be hoped indefinitely, of the
primrose. Here, too, Ophelia&#8217;s &#8220;long&ndash;purples&#8221; live again,
while under the shadow of the trees we descry her
&#8220;nettles,&#8221; those beautiful golden yellow ones that do not
sting, and which blend so perfectly with the orchis and
the crow&ndash;flower. One fears almost to descend to the
edge of the stream, for willows are there that grow
&#8220;aslant,&#8221; and that have &#8220;envious slivers&#8221; as of old.
Once in these lovely meadows it is easy to find the way
into the lower Bollin valley, and thence to Ashley and
Bowdon. But the double walk is rather long, and
prudence says return to Wilmslow. Norcliffe and
Oversley, it should be added, are reached as regards
carriage&ndash;way, by a nearly straight road from Handforth.</p>

<p>Lindow Common, famed from time immemorial for its
bracing air, extends from Wilmslow to Brook Lane.
There is nothing particular to be seen upon it, except by
the naturalist, who, in one part or another, finds abundance
to give him pleasure. The locality is remarkable
alike for its sundews and the profusion of wild bees; it
is one of the best known to entomologists for the class
Andrenid&aelig;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Women, it has been remarked, need no eulogy, since
they speak for themselves. Something similar, descriptively,
might be said of Alderley Edge. Whatever smoke&ndash;engendered
thoughts may occupy the mind for twenty
minutes after contemplating Stockport, they are effectually
dispelled by the sight of the piny hill, a medley of nature
and art, that shows so proudly in front as soon as the train
crosses the Bollin. A grand undulating mass of sandstone,
rising boldly out of the plain, of considerable
elevation,&mdash;the highest point being six hundred and fifty
feet above the sea,&mdash;and, reckoning to the out&ndash;of&ndash;sight
portion which overlooks Bollington, quite two miles in
length, must needs be impressive. Alderley gathers
charm also from its great smooth slants of green, rough
and projecting rocks, and trees innumerable, three or
four aged and wind&ndash;beaten firs upon the tip&ndash;top, giving
admirable accentuation. Every portion in view from the
railway is accessible by paths, usually easy, these introducing
us to many a deep and sequestered glade that in
autumn is crowded with ferns, or leading to the crest of
the hill, the views from which compensate all possible
fatigue of climbing. The simplest route to follow is that
by the old road running to Macclesfield. From the
lower part of this we may take one of the bye&ndash;roads that
lie to the left, and thus get eventually to the somewhat
rough and scrambling, but still quite practicable and
pleasant, track which leads along the face of the great
westward incline. This huge slope, called the &#8220;Hough,&#8221;
may be ascended also from beneath, keeping along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
foot for about a mile, then turning up through a field.
Green shades and leafy labyrinths here tempt to a never&ndash;slackening
onward movement, especially in that part
where a great curve in the mountain&ndash;mass gives rise to a
kind of bay, grassy always, and that in spring teems with
anemones. The prospect from the Hough is everywhere
magnificent, extending to Delamere Forest and the
Overton hills, which, like Coniston &#8220;alt maen,&#8221; have a
profile never doubtful. The intermediate broad, flat
space is the now familiar North Cheshire plain. Should
a canopy of smoke be distinguishable, it will indicate
Manchester. To enjoy this wonderful prospect perfectly,
it is best to adventure to the edge of &#8220;Stormy Point,&#8221; or
the Holywell Rock&mdash;that noted crag which, in case of
need, would serve well for a new Tarpeian. Another
quite different way to the top of the Edge is to proceed
a short distance along the Congleton road, or that which
leads, in the first instance, towards old Alderley village;
then to turn up a lane upon the left, which, passing
through a grove of fir&ndash;trees, terminates in the Macclesfield
road, near the &#8220;Wizard.&#8221; It is behind this noted
hostelry, commemorative in its name of the local legend,
that the sylvan loveliness of Alderley Edge is felt most
exquisitely, nature seeming here to have been left more
to her own sweet wantonness; while the views, extending
now over a totally different country, hills instead of a
plain, add to our previous enjoyments the always welcome
one of surprise. Curling round this glorious promontory,
we gradually progress towards the &#8220;Beacon,&#8221; the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
point, and in a few minutes, descending thence, are once
again in the public thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Alderley Park, the seat of Lord Stanley, lies near the
village, upon the left of the turnpike road. Strangers
very rarely enter the gates. The wonder to those who
do is that so little should have been made of natural
advantages scarcely excelled anywhere in Cheshire. The
best features are the magnificent beech&ndash;trees and the
sheet of ornamental water, called Radnor Mere, upon
the margins of which grow two of the most interesting
of the British sedges, the <i>Carex ampullacea</i> and the
<i>Carex vesicaria</i>. The gardens have long been noted
for their mulberry trees.</p>

<p>Beyond this again is Birtles, the neighbourhood of
which supplies a very pleasant walk. Mounting the hill
on the southern side, or where the latter gently melts
away into the level, the road in question leads eventually
to the &#8220;Wizard,&#8221; at which point, if more convenient, the
walk may be commenced. If begun at the base, we
turn up by the four&ndash;armed guide&ndash;post, a little beyond
Alderley church. The walk is somewhat long, therefore
better deferred till winter, selecting a day when the frost
is keen and the atmosphere bracing. A winter forenoon,
when the atmosphere is motionless, and icicles hang from
the little arches that bridge the water&ndash;courses, is every
bit as enjoyable as the most brilliant of summer evenings,
let only the heart be alive and the eyes trained to seeing.
Over and above the rich healthfulness of this Birtles
walk, all the way up to the crown of the Edge, and round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
about amid the trees in winter, for the artist of pre&ndash;Raphael
vision, there is bijouterie;&mdash;the chaste and
tender arabesque given to rock and aged bough by green
moss and grey and golden lichen, gems of nature that
when the trees are leafy are apt to be skipped, but when
all else is cold and bare, like faithful affection, &#8220;make
glad the solitary place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Between Alderley and Chelford, pushing still further
along the Congleton road, we find yet another of the
Cheshire meres, this one, in itself in the time of water&ndash;lilies,
worth all the travel. Reeds Mere, famous in local
fairy tale, is to the painter and the poet, when the lilies
are out, a floral Venice. Virtually, it is in Capesthorne
Park, the seat of one of the younger branches of the very
ancient Davenport family. To get to the water&#8217;s edge, if
time be short, the nearest point to start from is Chelford,
but the road above indicated is so charmingly wooded,
that not to go that way is distinctly a loss. Chelford
village may be reached by a field walk, commenced first
below Alderley church, crossing the meadow slantwise
and leftwards, and so past Heywood Hall, going presently
through a plantation of Scotch firs. Hard by
there is another charming seat, with spacious park, rare
trees, and ornamental water&mdash;Astle Hall, the residence
of Captain Dixon. In the grounds we are reminded of
Norcliffe, for here, too, is shown the love of Conifers
which always indicates good taste.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN for our country pleasure an entire day
can be commanded, Crewe, ten or twelve
miles from Chelford, and thirty&ndash;one from
Manchester, marks the way to Combermere
Abbey and Beeston Castle&mdash;places alike of
singular interest, though of totally different
character. To reach Combermere, it is
needful to continue a little distance along the line which
diverges from Crewe for Shrewsbury, booking to and
alighting at Wrenbury. Two or three different routes
may be taken thence, in any case by pleasant fields and
lanes not difficult to discover. The shortest way is to go
first across Mr. Wilson&#8217;s broad acres of model farm&ndash;land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
cereals right and left; then along a lane with a mill&ndash;pond
upon the left; then through a corridor of trees upon the
right, the floor, green as their boughs, bordered like a
missal, shortly after issuing from which we arrive at the
beautiful water referred to in the Abbey name. More
than a mile in length, covering one hundred and thirty&ndash;two
acres, and much too irregular in outline to be seen
at once in its full extent, Combermere, with its adjacent
woods, yields as a picture only to Rostherne. The paths
in every direction are full of landscape. Though the
country is flat, we do not perceive it to be so, and what may
be wanting in grandeur, is found in tranquillity and repose.
The mansion, of which there is an admirable view across
the mere, occupies the site of the ancient monastery&mdash;a
Benedictine, founded in 1133. Strictly modern, plain
and substantial, there is nothing about the exterior to
preserve the memory of monastic times; inside, however,
old and new are let shake hands, the library being an
adaptation of the ancient refectory. The walls, the
galleries, and the principal apartments contain great store
of Indian trophies and curiosities, brought home by the
renowned Sir Stapleton&ndash;Cotton, whose bravery in the
Peninsular War, and afterwards at the siege and capture
of Bhurtpore, gained for him the title first of Baron, and
then of Viscount, now held by the Lord Combermere,
his son.</p>

<p>A similar short ride from Crewe, now by the line which
continues to Chester, conveys us to Beeston, the walk
from which station to the castle, occupying less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
half an hour, is again by lanes and fields. Lancaster
Castle, excepting its incomparable gateway&ndash;tower, and
a small portion inside, has been so much altered in order
to adapt it for modern uses, that the past is lost in
the present. Clitheroe Castle is all gone, excepting the
keep. Beeston, happily, though itself only a relic, has
suffered nothing at the hands of the modern architect.
Even time seems to look on it leniently. As a memorial
of the feudal ages, it is in our own part of England
supreme and uncontested, and in any case one of the
most charming resorts within the distance for all in
Manchester who care for the majestic, the antique, and
the picturesque. This famous and far&ndash;seen ruin is seated
upon the brow of a mighty rock, which, rising out of the
meadows on the eastern side by a regular and at first
easy, but afterwards somewhat steep incline, terminates,
on the western side, in an abrupt and absolutely vertical
precipice, the brink of which is three hundred and sixty&ndash;six
feet above the level of the base, or of almost precisely
the elevation of the High Tor at Matlock, and of the
loftier parts of St. Vincent&#8217;s. Hence, in the distance,
viewed sideways, as for example, from Alderley Edge,
the outline is exactly that of a cone&ndash;shaped mountain
toppled over and lying prostrate. The broad green
slope, dry and velvety, furnishes an unsurpassed natural
lawn for rest and pic&ndash;nic. Mounting it to the summit,
the ruins, which now consist chiefly of ivied bastions,
tower above our heads with an inexpressible and mournful
grandeur that recalls the story of Caractacus in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
streets of ancient Rome. The mind runs back to the
time when the walls were alive with armed men, and
shouts rose from the turrets, now discrowned. Not that
the castle was ever actually assaulted, for a glance at the
entrance is enough to convince any one that as a military
post in the feudal times it was impregnable. Of military
incidents connected with Beeston, there is indeed no
record whatever. All that history has to tell is of one or
two changes in the holding, brought about by treachery
or want of vigilance. But from the time of the building,
in 1220, by Randulph de Blondeville, sixth Earl of
Chester, on his return from Palestine, there can be no
doubt that for four centuries the old castle was the scene
of much that was imposing.</p>

<p>Everything has vanished now, and for ever. Up on
that wonderful crag to&ndash;day, where the scene is so still,
and the &#8220;heavens&#8217; breath smells wooingly,&#8221; we feel far
more profoundly than in streets and cities, how grateful
is the dominion of peace compared with the turbulence
of war. For, looking over the westward parapet, at our
feet is Vale Royal, a warm and smiling plain that
stretches, literally, to the rim of the landscape. Randulph
looked upon those far away Welsh mountains, the Frodsham
hills, the estuaries of the Dee and the Mersey, all
so beautiful as ingredients in the magnificent prospect.
To&ndash;day we have that which he did <i>not</i> see, and probably
never imagined. Scattered over this glorious map are
villages, homesteads, orchards, gardens innumerable; the
vast breadth of bright emerald and sunny pasture laced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
with hedgerows that in spring are blossom&ndash;dappled, and
streams, of which, although so distant, we get twinkling
glimpses among the leafage. If it be autumn, the scene
is chequered with the hues of harvest, every field plainly
distinguishable, for one of the peculiar charms of the
view from Beeston Castle rock, granting a favourable
day, with lucid atmosphere, is that while the country is
brimful, every element is well&ndash;defined. Later still, we
may watch October winding its tinted way through the
green summer of the reluctant trees;&mdash;this, no doubt, it
did just in the same sweet old amber&ndash;sandalled fashion five
centuries ago, but the trees did not then, as now, cast
their shadows upon liberty and civilisation. Two periods
there are when Beeston calls upon us to remember, with a
sigh, that there are forms of beauty in the world in which
we may not hope to revel many times, perhaps, in their
perfection, not more than once or twice. One is mid&ndash;winter,
when in the great hush of the virgin snow the
landscape becomes a world carved in spotless marble;
the other, when the corn is waiting the sickle, and the
vast plain is steeped in sunset such as August only
witnesses. Watched from this tall rock, the wind&ndash;sculptured
clouds that an hour before were glistening
pearl slowly change to purple mountains, while the
molten gold boils up above their brows; these go, and
by and by there are left only bars of delicate rose, and
veils of fading asphodel, and at last we are with old
Homer and the camp before Troy, &#8220;when the stars are
seen round the bright moon, and the air is breathless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and all beacons, and lofty summits, and forests appear,
and the shepherd is delighted in his mind.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> So that,
adding all together, the value of the grand old stronghold
has in no wise died out, but only taken another shape.
Instead of inspiring awe and terror, it supplies the heart
with noble enjoyments, and with new and animating
incentives to seek the rewards that attend love of the
pure and beautiful.</p>

<p>When at Beeston, on descending from the castle, we
visit, as a matter of course, Peckforton, a mile beyond,
the residence of Lord Tollemache.</p>

<p>This splendid edifice restores, in the finest possible
manner, the irregular Norman style of architecture prevalent
in the reign of Edward I. Occupying a space of
not less than nine thousand square yards, and not more
remarkable for the superb proportions than for the perfect
finish of every part, in Cheshire it has no equal. Peckforton
has peculiar interest also in the circumstance of
the walls being entirely devoid of paint and paper, thus
presenting a contrast to the dressed surfaces favoured in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
modern times that for the moment is overwhelming.
The hill upon which it stands is covered with natural
wood, and in the remote parts gives way to heathery
wilderness. To pursue this for any considerable distance,
when half the day has already been given to Beeston,
of course is not possible. Begun early enough, we find
it almost continuous with the heights reached by way of
Broxton.</p>

<p>After the bastions and the gateway of Beeston Castle,
the curiosity of the place is the ancient well, sunk through
the rock to Beeston Brook, a depth of three hundred
and seventy feet, but now quite dry. A trayful of lighted
candles is let down by a windlass for the entertainment
of visitors who care to see the light diminish to a speck.
On the way to Peckforton, it must not be overlooked,
either, that in a pretty garden upon the right will be
found Horsley Bath, limpid water perpetually running
out of the rock, and in restorative powers, if the legends
be true, a genuine &#8220;fountain of rejuvenescence.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT speaks not a little for the vigorous and
buoyant life of the immediate neighbourhood
of our town that so few examples are to be
met with of decay and ruin. Turn whichever
way we will, we find new houses, new factories,
new enterprises, but scarcely an instance of
wasting away and dilapidation. The nearest important
relic of the feudal times is Beeston Castle, just described;
and the nearest memorial and sepulchre of those brave,
good men who, while the rulers of our country were
fighting and oppressing, conserved within the convent
walls learning, religion, charity, and a hundred other
things that kept the national civilisation moving until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
aurora of the Reformation, is Whalley Abbey, also more
than thirty miles away. Excepting a few old houses of
little significance, everything about us is intact, occupied
usefully, and a fine testimony to the intelligence and the
energy of the province. Let a stranger visit any part of
the country within the radius indicated, and he will feel
that he is in a place where life is concentrated: everything
bespeaks nerve; whatever has died seems to have
been succeeded on the instant by a more powerful thing.
Like a laurel&ndash;tree, we are dressed in this district in the
foliage of perennial and vehement vitality; while there
is plenty of solid stem to mark honourable antiquity,
the leaves that have gone have but made way for new
and larger ones.</p>

<p>These reflections have been suggested by a visit to
Arden Hall, the solitary exception to the strong, unyielding
life of the vicinity. Upon this account alone it is a
place of interest. The situation, also, is one of the most
delightful ever selected for a country residence. The
locality may be described, in general terms, as on the
Cheshire bank of the river Tame, about half&ndash;way between
Stockport and Hyde. The Tame separates Lancashire
from that odd bit of Cheshire which, running up in a
kind of peninsula at its north&ndash;east corner, terminates
with Mossley and Tintwistle, the Etherowe forming its
boundary on the opposite side, and dividing it from
Derbyshire. Few would suppose it possible, but the
county of Cheshire is at this point scarcely more than
two miles across! The ruin itself is easily found, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
way to it being by Levenshulme and Reddish,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> inquiring
there for the Reddish paper&ndash;mills, which lie in the valley
on the Lancashire side of the river, and are approached
by a steep descent, with beautiful views of the surrounding
country in front and upon the left. Crossing the
river by the mills, mounting the hill, going through a few
fields and a grove of trees, right before us, sooner than
expected, stands the hall, a large, tall square building of
grey stone. At first sight, it appears to be in tolerable
preservation. The remains of the old sun&ndash;dial are still
visible, the diamonded casements of some of the windows
are perfect, and the exterior generally is undefaced. But
the illusion soon passes away. Penetrating to the inside,
the great hall&mdash;a noble apartment, some eleven yards by
eight&mdash;is found heaped with rubbish and fallen beams;
the ceiling, once ornamented with pendent points, is all
gone, except a small portion in one corner; it seems a
wonder that the roof still cares to stay. A slender turret,
rising above the rest of the fabric, includes a circular
staircase, leading to the gallery of the upper floor. Here
the diamonded casements reappear, looking full into the
western sky, and over the trees and river winding at the
foot of the steep; and here we discover the loveliness
of the site. Abundantly wooded, strewn with fertile
meads, and opening out in every direction pretty views
of distant hills, with yet more distant ones peeping over
their shoulders, there is not a more picturesque valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
east of Manchester, that is to say, not until we are fairly
into Derbyshire, than is spread before the windows of
forsaken Arden. There is not a spot upon its slopes
where we may not pause and admire, and wish for our
friends. As at Beeston, the mind quickly travels back
to the lang syne. Out of those windows, through the
open casements, how often have the eyes of fair girls
gazed, in sweet summer evenings, long and peacefully,
upon the woods and winding water, and painted sunset,
one generation after another, all gone now, their ancient
home crumbling to dust&mdash;but the woods and winding
water and sunset the same. The poets talk of nature&#8217;s
sympathy with man; there is nothing so marked as her
lofty indifference to him.</p>

<p>Arch&aelig;ologically, Arden is interesting as a fine specimen
of the domestic architecture of the sixteenth century, and
is remarkable for its unusually large bay windows. The
waterspouts are inscribed 1597. The history of the
estate and its proprietors dates, however, as far back as
the time of King John, and though no direct evidence is
within reach, there is reason to believe that an earlier
building once stood near, and that the present ruin is
the second hall. John o&#8217; Gaunt is said to have been an
inmate of the original. The family history may be seen
at length in Ormerod&#8217;s &#8220;Cheshire,&#8221; in the third volume
of which work, p. 399, is a drawing of the hall as it
appeared before relinquished to decay. Visitors to the
Art&ndash;Treasures Exhibition of 1857 will recollect Mr.
C. H. Mitchell&#8217;s pretty water&ndash;colour view of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
place, and there are few, perhaps, of our local artists who
have not sketched it. It would appear from the date of
Ormerod&#8217;s work &#40;1819&#41;, where the hall is described as
containing furniture and paintings, that it has been
deserted only since the death of George III. Until
recently one of its curiosities was a stone pulpit, in which
it is said Oliver Cromwell once preached. The rustic
legend of the place is that, once upon a time, long before
powder and shot were invented, there lived hereabouts a
doughty baron. On the opposite side of the valley was
a similar castle, held by a rival baron, who returned his
neighbour&#8217;s jealousy with interest. These two worthies
used to spend their time in shooting at one another with
bows and arrows, till at last, tired of long range, and
such desultory warfare, the Baron of Arden collected his
dependents, dived down into the valley, scaled the
opposite heights, slaughtered his enemy, and so utterly
demolished his castle, that now not a vestige of it is
discoverable.</p>

<p>There is generally some good foundation for such
legends. Upon the eastern side of the hall, some
distance from the moat, traces of ancient earthworks
are discoverable, extending towards the present &#8220;Castle&ndash;hill,&#8221;
and which probably protected some simple fortification.
Flint arrow&ndash;heads and other relics of primitive
weapons found in the soil of the adjacent fields sustain
the conjecture, and in truth a better seat for a manorial
stronghold it would not be easy to select. The appellation
of the ancient fortress when superseded by a building of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
more peaceful character, would naturally be transferred
to the latter, and after the lapse of a little time, nothing
more than the name would survive to tell the story.
Originally it was Arderne, as in the reference by Webb,
in 1622, to another seat of the family, &#8220;A fine house
belonging to Henry Arderne, Esq.&#8221; In any case, the
prefix of an <i>H</i> appears to be erroneous, if nothing worse.
The last of this name was the Richard Pepper Arderne,
born at the old hall, and educated at the Manchester
Grammar School, who in 1801, three years before his
death, was raised to the peerage, with the title of Baron
Alvanley. Arden Hall is not only remarkable in being
built wholly of stone, when so many other mansions of
the period were timber, but in the high&ndash;pitched roof of
the tower&mdash;a feature rarely observable in such edifices.</p>

<p>Leaving the hall, the road descends rapidly towards
the river, here crossed by a stone bridge, shortly before
reaching which there are some cottages upon the left. At
one of these, with the name &#8220;Thomas Ingham&#8221; over the
door, a nice tea may be obtained. It is not a very
attractive place to look at, but the parlour &#40;at the back&#41;
is as comfortable as any lady could desire; the provision
is excellent, the attendance prompt and respectful, and
the charge so moderate that it seems wonderful how it
can pay. Forget not that in visiting such places the
obligation is mutual. Excursionists have no sort of claim
upon private houses, and should be glad to recompense
with liberality the kindly willingness to accommodate,
save for which they might have to plod for miles hungry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and tired. Tea disposed of, we have a walk homewards
even more pleasing than the first, by taking, that is, the
contrary or Lancashire side of the river, and thus passing
through the very woods admired an hour previously from
the hall and the crest of the hill. The way is first over
the stone bridge, then for a little distance up the hill,
descending thence into the field&ndash;path, found by means of
a large circular brick structure in one of the meadows,
seemingly the ventilation mouth of a coal&ndash;mine. There
is a path quite close to the river, if preferred, entered
almost immediately after crossing the bridge, but the
water after wet weather is apt to be disagreeable, and in
autumn there is a thick and laborious jungle of butter&ndash;bur
leaves. The hill&ndash;side at this point is decidedly the
best place for viewing the hall, which crowns the tall cliff
immediately in front of it. It is hard to think, as we
contemplate its lovely adjuncts, how so romantic a site
could have been deserted. The woods hanging the hill&ndash;sides
with their beautiful tapestry, the river creeping
quietly in the bottom, but seen only in shining lakelets
where the branches of the trees disentangle themselves,
and make a green lacework of light twig and leaf, just
dense enough to serve as a thin veil, and just open enough
to let the eye pierce it and be delighted; the perfect
calm of the whole scene, and the sweet allurement of the
path with every additional step, how came they to be
ignored? Approaching Reddish the woods are unfenced,
and the path lies almost beneath the trees. At the end
of May these woods are suffused with the brightest blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in every direction,&mdash;the bloom of the innumerable wild
hyacinth, which clusters here in great banks and masses,
so close that the green of the foliage is concealed. The
ground being a slope, and viewed from below, the effect
is most singular and striking. Shakspeare speaks of
&#8220;making the green one red;&#8221; here we have literally the
green made blue. In the same woods grows the forget&ndash;me&ndash;not,
in abundance only exceeded in the Morley
meadows. One might almost fancy that the nymphs of
ancient poetry had been transmigrated into these sweet
turquoise&ndash;coloured flowers. Among the specialities of
the Reddish valley, mentioned before as eminently rich
in plants of interest, are the bird&ndash;cherry, <i>Prunus Padus</i>,
and that curious fern the <i>Lunaria</i>. The first is quite
a different thing from the ordinary wild cherry of
Mobberley, Peover, Lymm, and the Bollin valley, having
long, pendulous clusters of white flowers, like those of the
laburnum, and with a smell of honey. It is seen not
only as a tree, but sometimes forms part of the hedges.
The lunaria grows in the meadows, and is in perfection
about the end of May. In August and September the
river&ndash;banks here are gay also with the fine crimson of
the willow&ndash;herb, the young shoots of which, along with
the flowers, drawn through the half&ndash;closed hand, leave
behind them a grateful smell of baked apples and cream.</p>

<p>The upper portion of the valley, nearer Hyde, was
very diligently and successfully explored in 1840&ndash;42 by
Mr. Joseph Sidebotham, then resident at Apethorne,&mdash;a
townsman whom we have not more reason to be proud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
as a naturalist of the most varied and accurate information,
and as one of the most scientific and successful
prosecutors of microscopical research, than as a singularly
skilful artist in photography, and this without letting the
colours grow dry upon the palette from which he has
been accustomed to transfer them to coveted drawings.
It was Mr. Sidebotham who first drew the attention of
Manchester naturalists to the fresh&ndash;water alg&aelig; of our
district, and who principally determined their forms and
numbers. He also it was who collected the principal
portion known up to 1858 of the local <i>Diatomace&aelig;</i>.
During the five or six years he devoted to the botany of
Bredbury, Reddish, and the banks of the Tame generally,
he added no fewer than twenty&ndash;five species to the Manchester
Flora, many of them belonging to the difficult
genera <i>Rubus</i> and <i>Carex</i>. His walks were not often
solitary. What a broiling day was that on which we
first gathered in the Reddish valley the great white
cardamine!&mdash;what a sweet forenoon that vernal one
when we stood contemplating the thousand anemones!
Nature seems to delight again in <i>upsetting</i> everything
human! One cannot even bestow a name, but she tries
to undermine it. No epithet is more appropriate, as a
rule, to this most modest of the anemone race, the wild
English one, than its specific name, nemorosa, &#8220;inhabiting
the groves;&#8221;&mdash;every reader of classical verse recalls,
as the eye glides over the word, the <i>nemus</i> which grew
greener wherever Phyllis set her foot in it. Giving her
the least chance, see, nevertheless, how the wayward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
lady to whom we owe everything, laughs alike at ourselves
and our nomenclature. We call the flower nemorosa,
conclude that all is settled, and straightway, as in that
sweet and still forenoon in the Reddish valley &#40;1840&#41;,
she flings it by handfuls over the sward, and leaves the
grove as she then left the Arden woods, without a blossom
and without a leaf. Similar curious departure from the
accustomed habitat of the wood&ndash;anemone has since been
observed at Cheadle and at Alderley.</p>

<p>No slight pleasure is it in connection with botany that
plants and events thus link themselves together, recalling
whole days of tranquil happiness spent with valued friends
in the green fields. Associations with trees and flowers
seem almost inevitably pleasant and graceful ones; at all
events, we never hear of the reverse. When orators and
poets want objects for elegant simile and comparison,
they find trees and flowers supply them most readily; and,
on the other hand, how rarely are these beautiful productions
of nature used for the illustration of what is vicious
and degrading, or in any way mixed up with what is vile
and disgraceful. Trees and flowers lead us, by virtue of their
kindly influences on the heart and the imagination, to a
disrelish and forgetfulness of the uncomely, and to think
better of everything around us; so that a walk in the
fields, over and above its invigorating and refreshing value,
acts as a kindly little preacher, and shows us that we may
at all events read, if not</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p><i>Honi soit qui mal y pense</i>, write,<br />
In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue, and white.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The lapse of twenty&ndash;four years has not tended to
improve the aspect of the Reddish valley. The main
features are the same, but the brightness is sadly dimmed.
Everything now, in 1882, illustrates the operation of town
smoke and hurtful vapours, not to mention the devastating
influences which come of human travel. The wild&ndash;flowers
have shared the fate of those in other suburban
localities; the old hall has sunk further towards decay;
the Inghams, happily, are extant. Mr. Sidebotham,
for his own part, practices, amid the refinements of his
Bowdon home, all that he cultivated originally upon the
banks of the little river, and with the added success that
arises upon unbroken assiduity. He tells me now of his
researches into the entomology of Dunham Park, where
not long ago, for one or two successive seasons, in July,
a curious beetle occurred in plenty, a fact immensely
remarkable, since only one other of its kind has ever
been noticed elsewhere in England, this upon an oak in
Windsor Forest as far back as 1829! The insect was first
detected by Mr. Joseph Chappell, a working mechanic
at Sir Joseph Whitworth&#8217;s, and one of the most careful
observers of nature now in our midst.</p>

<p class="small">The first photographs ever shown in Manchester were laid before
a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society by the late

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">STOCKPORT, the uninviting, in whatever
direction we look to escape from it, is a
point of rare value for departure for scenes
of interest&mdash;this mainly because of its
standing on the threshold of the hills which
a little further on become members of the
English Apennine,&mdash;the grand range stretching from
Derbyshire to the Cheviots. Soon after passing Edgley,
while the original line pursues its course to Wilmslow
and Alderley, great branches strike out upon the left,
one primarily for Macclesfield, the other for Disley and
Buxton. Each in its turn leads to scenes of delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
beauty, and that before the time of railways were scarcely
known. Alighting at Bramhall, we secure the added
pleasure of a visit to the very celebrated old hall of that
name&mdash;the most admirable example in our district of the
&#8220;magpie&#8221; style of architecture, and not more charming
in its external features than rich in interest within. The
oldest portions date from soon after the middle of the
fourteenth century, and are thus as nearly as possible
contemporaneous as to period of building with the choir
of York Minster. These very aged portions are found
chiefly in connection with the entrance to the chapel.
Massive beams and supports, hard as iron, refusing the
least dint of the knife, and presenting the peculiar surface
characteristic of the work of their time, attest very plainly
the profound significance of &#8220;heart of oak.&#8221; Everything,
moreover, in this grand old place is so solidly laid
together, so compactly and impregnably knit, that it
seems as if it would serve pretty nearly for the base of
another Eddystone or Cleopatra&#8217;s needle. In the most
tempestuous of winter nights, Bramhall has never been
known to flinch a hair&#8217;s breadth&mdash;so, at least, the late
Colonel Davenport used to assure his friends, the writer
of these lines included. No portions of the building
appear to be of later date than the time of Elizabeth,
the domestic architecture of whose reign is nowhere in
England better interpreted. The situation of Bramhall
is on a par with its artistic qualities. No dull soul was
it who more than five hundred years ago selected for his
abode the crest of that gentle declivity, trees far and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
near, a stream gliding below, and views from the upper
windows that reach for many miles across the undulating
and sweetly variegated greensward. The romantic bit at
present is the ravine hard by, saturated in spring with
tender wild&ndash;flowers, the wood&ndash;sorrel in myriads.</p>

<p>Prestbury, a few miles beyond, also has great attractions
for the antiquary, the chancel and south aisle of the
church being of about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1130, while the school&ndash;house
in the graveyard is entered by a doorway with apparently
Norman mouldings. The tower is about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1460. If
in search more particularly of rural pastime, we take the
contrary side of the line, and so through the lanes and
fields to the delicious Kerridge hills. Remarkable for
their very sudden rise out of the plain, these green and
airy hills command views, like those obtained at Alderley,
of truly charming extent and variety. Tegsnose, at the
southern extremity, is thirteen hundred feet above the
sea&ndash;level&mdash;the little building just above Bollington, called
&#8220;White Nancy,&#8221; plainly visible from the line near
Wilmslow when the sunlight falls on it, is nine hundred
and thirty feet;&mdash;no wonder that from this last, since
there is nothing to intercept, the prospect in favourable
weather reaches to Liverpool, and even to the sweet
wavy lavender upon the horizon that indicates North
Wales.</p>

<p>Bollington is now reached also by a line &#40;part of the
Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire system,&#41; which
diverges for Macclesfield at Woodley Junction. This
perhaps gives nearer approach to the Kerridge hills; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
any case, it is the best to take for the extremely beautiful
adjacent neighbourhood, which for its little metropolis
has the village of Pott Shrigley. Before the opening
of the line in question, the station for this part was
Adlington, on the London and North&ndash;Western. Grand
as the prospects have already been, above Pott Shrigley,
excepting only the &#8220;castled crag&#8221; at Beeston, all are
surpassed. No lover of the illimitable need go to
Cumberland or Carnarvonshire for a sight more glorious.
Alderley Edge, rising out of the plain below, seems
only a mound. The plain itself stretches away far
more remotely than the eye can cover, no eminence of
magnitude occurring nearer than the Overton hills. The
towers and spires of Bowdon and Dunham are plainly
distinguishable; and close by, in comparison, is the fine
western extremity of the Kerridge range, with &#8220;White
Nancy,&#8221;&mdash;the hill itself on which we stand, or rather
seat ourselves, remembering the picture in Milton,</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p><span class="add8em">See how the bee,</span><br />
Sitting assiduous on the honeyed bloom,<br />
Sucks liquid sweet,</p></div>

<p class="noindent">just such a one as suggested that other immortal portrait,</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>Green, and of mild declivity, the last,<br />
As &#8217;twere the cape of a long ridge of such,<br />
Save that there is no sea to lave its base,<br />
But a most living landscape.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">The time to go to this glad pinnacle is at the end of
May or the beginning of June, mounting the hill in the
first instance, by the immediate route from the station.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
When the time arrives to descend, dip westwards, curve
round by the water, and through the fields which lead
into the Disley road, thence into Pott Shrigley village.
No description can convey a perfect idea of the loveliness
of this part of the walk at the season indicated. The
long&ndash;extended survey of hill and dale, the innumerable
trees, clothing the slopes at agreeable distances with the
most picturesque of little woodlands, bright and cheerful
in their unsullied raiment of leaves that are only yet
learning the sweetness of sunshine; the rise and fall of
the ground; the incessant turns and sinuosities of the
pathway, every separate item is a treat, and yet the
ravishing spectacle of all, at the season referred to, has
still to be named. This consists in the inexpressible, the
infinite multitude of the bluebells, which far surpasses
that of the old Reddish valley. They saturate every
slope and recess that is in any degree shady, and diffuse
themselves even upon the otherwise bare hill&ndash;sides, not
in a thin and niggardly way, but with the semblance
of an azure mist. In many parts, at the edges of the
little groves, where the ground is steep, they seem to be
flowing in streams into the meadows beneath, and where
there are breaks among the nearer trees they actually
illuminate the opening. When the spectacle of the bluebells
comes to an end, the walk continues along a
beautiful green arcade, straight, level, and uninterrupted
into the village.</p>

<p>By whichever of the two routes we prefer to go to
Macclesfield, that ancient and celebrated town becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in itself a new and excellent starting point. If desiring
to go beyond, the London and North&ndash;Western should be
chosen. The massive heights on the way to Buxton,
including the well&ndash;known and far&ndash;conspicuous mamelon
called Shutlings Low, are accessible only by carriage or
on foot. North Rode, on the other hand, is but a few
minutes&#8217; continued railway journey, and for this, if we
come at all, the longest day is all too short. Just in front
rises Cloud&ndash;end, the mighty promontory seen from the
fields near Butts Clough <a href="#Page_23">&#40;p. 23&#41;</a>, covered with trees,
the <i>Vitis Id&aelig;a</i> filling the open spaces, and plenty of nuts
in the neighbouring hedgerows. Keeping the mountain
to the left, descending the green lane, and passing, &#8220;on
sufferance,&#8221; through North Rode Park, agreeable scenery
on each side all the way, the end is that <i>beau&ndash;ideal</i> of a
rural retreat, pretty Gawsworth. The ancient trees, the
venerable church, the dignified old residences, all speak
at once of a long&ndash;standing and undisturbed respectability
such as few villages can now assert. In the
graveyard stand patriarchal yews, one of them, reduced
to a torso, encased in ivy, and protected on the weaker
side by a little wall of steps, intended seemingly to make
it useful as a tree&ndash;pulpit. Six great walnut&ndash;trees form part
of the riches of the Hall, another pleasing old &#8220;magpie;&#8221;
water also is near at hand, thronged with fishes that
sport near the surface, and gliding through the sunbeams
gleam like silver. To return to Macclesfield there is no
need to retrace one&#8217;s steps to North Rode, the walk being
short and pleasant, and rendered peculiarly interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
by its beech&ndash;trees, a long and noble avenue, if contemplated
through an opera&ndash;glass never to be forgotten,
for then the half&ndash;mile of leafy colonnade is brought
close to the eye, a green and moving stereoscopic
picture.</p>

<p>When at Gawsworth it is a pity to let slip the opportunity
of visiting Marton, for the sake alike of its fine
old hall, ancient church, and renowned oak. The hall,
like so many others in this part of the country, is a
black and white of the time of Elizabeth, supplying, in
the material, yet another illustration of the ancient plenty
in Cheshire of magnificent trees; Lancashire, though it
contains many old halls and manor&ndash;houses of the same
character, presenting a far more considerable proportion
of stone ones. In the old &#8220;magpies,&#8221; very generally, so
vast is the quantity of wood that one is disposed to
exclaim&mdash;Surely when this house was raised a forest must
have been felled. Inside there are many very interesting
relics, as one would expect in a primitive seat of the old
owners of Bramhall. The church, built in 1343, is in
the style of Peover and the oldest portion of Warburton,
the aisles being separated from the nave by oaken pillars.
As for the &#8220;Marton oak,&#8221; it needs only to say that in
dimensions it is an acknowledged rival of the Cowthorpe,
the circumference at a yard from the ground being fifty
feet, and at the height of a man more than forty feet. It
can hardly be called a &#8220;trunk,&#8221; if by that word we are
to understand a solid mass of timber, the inner portion
having long since decayed, leaving only a shell, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the branches above are still vigorous and clothed every
season with unabating foliage.</p>

<p>Three or four miles beyond North Rode ancient
Congleton comes in view, opening the way, if we care
to enter Staffordshire, to Biddulph Grange, renowned for
its gardens. Mow Cop, just on the frontiers, awaits those
who love mountain air. Trentham Park, fifteen miles
further, or about forty&ndash;three from Manchester, is the seat,
as well&ndash;known, of the Duke of Sutherland; and not far,
again, from this is the Earl of Shrewsbury&#8217;s&mdash;Alton
Towers. To reach the latter, we diverge from North
Rode along the Churnet Valley line, the same which
leads, in the first instance, to the beautiful neighbourhood
of Rushton, famed for its ancient church, the untouched
beams of the same date as Beeston Castle; then past
Rudyard Lake and the delicious woods appertaining to
Cliffe Hall. The view from Rushton churchyard is one
for painters. The valley, receding southwards, encloses
the smooth expanse of Rudyard, which, though no more
than a reservoir, has all the winning ways of a Coniston
or a Windermere, seeking to elude one&#8217;s view by reliance
on friendly trees. In the north and east the hills rise
terrace&ndash;wise, range beyond range, each remoter one of
different hue, Shutlings Low, that beautiful mamelon,
towering above all, and more effectively than as contemplated
from any other point we know of. After this
comes the lovely walk through the woods themselves,
the water visible, intermittently, all the way, with at last
pause for rest, in Rudyard village. It is not a little singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
that Rudyard, like the reservoir at Lymm, should have
for its parent a river Dane, though here the stream does
not vanish, the Rudyard Dane being the boundary of
the two counties, Cheshire and Staffordshire.</p>

<p>Alton Towers, a trifle further, illustrate in the finest
manner what can be achieved by the skill of the landscape
gardener. At the time of Waterloo the grounds
were simple rabbit&ndash;warren, and the site of the present
mansion was occupied by only a cottage. Worthily is it
inscribed, just within the garden gate, &#8220;He made the
desert smile,&#8221; the <i>he</i> being Charles, the sixteenth earl,
under whose directions the work was executed. The
framework consists of two deep and winding valleys,
which lose themselves in a third of similar character. Over
their slopes have been diffused terraces, arbours, ivied
grottoes, trees and shrubs innumerable, green cypresses
that rise like spires among the round sycamores, and
rhododendrons that in May, looked at across the chasm,
seem changed to purple sea&ndash;foam. Wherever practicable,
there have been added waterfalls and aspiring fountains,
and threading in every direction there are moss&ndash;grown and
apparently interminable sylvan paths. From many points
of view, the scene is one no doubt that would have
captivated Claude or Salvator Rosa. Still, it must be
confessed that the impression, after survey, which lingers
longest in the mind is of something not simply lavish,
but inordinate. Very beautiful, without question, as an
essay in constructive art, therefore invaluable educationally,
one falls back, nevertheless, when departing, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the thought of tranquil Norcliffe, that never tires. The
earl, it may be interesting to add, to whom the Alton
grounds owe their existence, represented by lineal
descent the famous Talbot of the Maid of Orleans&#8217;
story. When we part with him, we may run on, if we
please, to Rocester Junction, and thence to Ashbourne,
the threshold of Dovedale, there to chat with immortal
Izaak Walton.</p>

<p>Shutlings Low, the old familiar and far&ndash;seen mamelon
above&ndash;mentioned, the only one we know of in Cheshire,
is considered also to be the highest ground in the county,
the summit reaching an elevation of over seventeen
hundred feet. The view which rewards the rather stiff
climb is like that from the crest of Mow Cop, not only
vast in compass, but very agreeably new, from commanding
as much as the eye can embrace of Staffordshire.
The ascent is best made from Wild Boar Clough, itself
the most picturesque of the many wild ravines which
betoken the near neighbourhood of Derbyshire. For
pedestrians the walk from Macclesfield to Buxton is also
a glorious one, Axe Edge intervening, with at about a
hundred feet below its topmost point the celebrated
hostelry, reputed to exceed in elevation even the
&#8220;Travellers&#8217; Rest&#8221; in Kirkstone Pass, and which in
name commemorates faithful Caton, <i>Caton fid&egrave;le</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the L. and N. W. opened its branch
from Stockport to Buxton, June 15th,
1863, every one loving the country had
visions of immense delight among the
sweet and then scarcely known hills of
Disley and Marple. Previously, they were
no more than an element of the scenery
observed from the Buxton coach. Since then we have
better understood the meaning of those grateful lines,</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>You gave me such sweet breath as made<br />
The things more rich.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">For if the fronts of these beautiful hills be sometimes
rugged, there are none that the western breezes better
love to caress, nor are there any that welcome the sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with a more strenuous hospitality. Disley and
Marple count not with the places which the sunshine
only flatters; they are always cheerful and pretty, whether
it be the hottest day of July, or winter, or spring. Even
after a storm, be it ever so vehement, they recover themselves
as rapidly as a child&#8217;s cheek after the tears. How
great and affable, too, their landscapes!&mdash;how bright their
lawn&ndash;like pastures, where tricolour daisies bloom all the
year round: there are woods moreover, in the recesses,
where we may bathe our eyes in the sweet calm that
comes only of green shade, and that like the airy summits
up above, give at the same moment both animation and
repose.</p>

<p>Disley is known to most of us as the first station after
Hazel&ndash;grove, and the point from which departure is taken
for Lyme Park. Intermediately there is a delightful
walk, reaching the greater part of the distance, upon the
right&ndash;hand side of the line, through the sylvan covert
called Middlewood. The wood is not &#8220;preserved.&#8221; It
is semi&ndash;private, nevertheless, so that permission to pass
through ought to be asked; it is rare, even then, to hear
any voices except our own and those of the birds.
Either to ascend, or to proceed by train direct to Disley,
and enter the wood at the head, is, in its way advantageous.
The latter is, perhaps, the better course, since
we then accompany the stream,&mdash;one of the very few so
near Manchester still unpolluted. The water is the same
as that which flows past Bramhall, running thence to
Cheadle, where its bubbles swim into the Mersey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Middlewood, unfortunately for its primitive charm, has
recently shared the fate of Gatley Carrs, so that the path
is now very inconveniently obstructed, and the Bramhall
part of this pretty brook, instead of being the inferior, is
to&ndash;day, perhaps, after all, the most pleasing. Comparisons
may be spared. The meadows it traverses were
never wanting in any substantial element of pastoral
charm, and if a thing be good absolutely, what need to
ask for more? The way to them is <i>vi&acirc;</i> Cheadle Hulme,
then to Lady Bridge, as far as Bramhall&ndash;green, there
crossing the road, and stepping anew upon the grass,
where the path returns to the water&ndash;side. Hence, we go
on to Mill&ndash;bank farm, told at once by its three great
yews, and for the return may take Hazel&ndash;grove.</p>

<p>The broad green slopes and expanses of Lyme Park,
though they partake of the loneliness of the neighbouring
moors, are, as indicated above, pleasant at every season
of the year. Nature, in truth, is always good, no matter
what the season is, if the people are so who seek it. As
we traverse them, in the south&ndash;west the eye rests upon
the great plain that stretches to Bowdon; upon the left,
on a swelling height, is the far&ndash;seen square grey tower
called Lyme Cage, clearly intended, when built, for a
huntsman&#8217;s refuge; and passing this it is not far to the
hall, upon which, being in a hollow, one comes so
suddenly as to be reminded of the adventures of the
knights&ndash;errant in tales of chivalry. A very fine quadrangular
gritstone building, partly Corinthian, partly Ionic,
some portion is nevertheless of the time of Elizabeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
The interior is also very various, in many portions stately
and richly ornamented, and literally crowded almost
everywhere with works of art, including a rude picture of
the original hall in the time of King John, with portraits,
heraldry, tapestry, stained glass, and wood&ndash;carving enough
to satisfy the most ravenous. The rare mosaic of fact
and fiction currently accepted as the family history of the
Leghs is well sustained by the armour and other antiquities,
not the least interesting of which is the font in
the chapel, in which for ages the youthful scions of the
house have been baptized. There is very little timber in
the park, though on the borders not wanting. The most
remarkable feature, as regards trees, is an avenue of over
seventy lindens.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_147" id="i_147"></a>

</div>

<p>The supreme part of Disley is that which lies on the
contrary side of the station, consisting in the green and
lofty crest called Jackson Edge. This is reached by
going a short distance along the Buxton road, then
mounting a steep ascent upon the left, cottages on either
side, and eventually through a lane upon the right. Due
west from the summit, like a garden viewed from a
balcony, the plain seen from Lyme Park is displayed
even more variously. When satisfied, we may curl round
by the stone&ndash;quarries, then through the fir&ndash;wood, and so
back into Disley village,&mdash;a little tour just enough for
those who not being very strong of limb, still go shares
with the strongest in zest for mountain breath and
extended prospects; or we may leave Disley again
behind, and, crossing a few meadows, mount glorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Marple Ridge.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Here the prospect becomes wider and
more varied still: filling one also with astonishment that
so much can be commanded at the cost of so little
labour. The fact is that the railway does half the climbing
for us, the line from Hazel Grove to Disley being
almost a slope. Standing with our backs to Disley
village, on the right towers the great green pyramid
called Cobden Edge; then come the hills that rise
above Whaley Bridge and Taxal, Kinder Scout resting
upon their shoulders. In front are hills again, Werneth
Low, always identified by the sky&ndash;line fringe of trees;
Stirrup&ndash;benches and Charlesworth Coombs, and the three&ndash;hill&ndash;churches
always remembered by their corresponding
initial, Marple, Mellor, and Mottram, with Chadkirk
and Compstall in the valley. Southwards, Lyme Cage
and Lyme Hall, the latter half&ndash;hidden among its trees,
are discoverable; and due west is the great plain
now familiar,&mdash;that one which includes Vale Royal, and
reaches to Chester. Let all who make a pilgrimage
hither remember, as when they visit Gawsworth, to bring
their opera&ndash;glasses, which however useful when there is
curiosity as to a cantatrice, have nowhere a more excellent
use than on the mountain&ndash;side. Cobden Edge,
from its greatly superior altitude, overlooks even Marple
Ridge! To reach it, after leaving Disley station, cross
the wood a little beyond the hotel, and go down a steep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
lane, arriving presently at a slit in the wall upon the
right, through which it is necessary to sidle as best one
may. The canal has then to be crossed, and the river
Goyt, after which there is a little glen leading the way
to the path up the hill. On the top, all the grandeurs of
Marple Ridge are renewed five&ndash;fold. Alderley has nearly
subsided into the plain. Beeston Castle is conspicuous.
Some say they can descry the great Ormes&ndash;head. Pursuing
the road along the crest of the hill, we soon arrive at
Marple village; or descending from it, upon the right,
get almost as soon into the beautiful valley of the Goyt.
Both, however, since 1867, have been rendered so much
more easily accessible by means of the Midland railway,
that they may be left for another chapter, the more
particularly since a few miles&#8217; continued ride from Disley
brings us to another charming neighbourhood&mdash;that one
which comprises the above&ndash;mentioned Whaley Bridge and
Taxal.</p>

<p>The most manageable of the many pleasant walks
within reach of the latter, is that one which leads to
Taxal church, following the high road till a white gate
upon the right opens into meadows descending into a
dell, where the swift and limpid waters, if they do not
exactly make &#8220;shallow falls,&#8221; at all events invite the
birds to sing their madrigals. Quitting the dell, the
path is once again upwards, soon reaching the church,
and after leaving this, through the grove of trees and
along the foot of the reservoir, the overflow from which
often seems a rushing snowdrift. This fine sheet of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
is one of several similar storages prepared for the Peak
Forest Canal, and supplies an admirable illustration of
the service rendered to scenery by business enterprise,
which if it sometimes destroys or mutilates, as in the case
of Gatley Carrs, compensates in the gift of broad and
shining lakes. An excellent characteristic of the great
Lancashire and Cheshire reservoirs is that ordinarily, when
in the country, like this one at Taxal, they resemble, as
nearly as possible, natural meres. Established, as at
Lymm, by damming up the narrow outlet of some little
valley through which a stream descends, the water, as it
accumulates, is allowed, as far as practicable, to determine
its own boundaries; hence, excepting the one inevitable
straight line required for the dam, though this can sometimes
be dispensed with, the margin winds, the banks
become shore&ndash;like, and the landscape is exquisitely
enriched. No landscape is perfectly beautiful without
water, and nowhere has so much been done undesignedly
for scenic beauty than in our two adjacent counties. The
same is true of the addition given by noble railway&ndash;arches
to hollows filled with trees. Scenery impregnated with
the outcome of human intelligence and human skill must
needs, in the long run, always take deepest hold of our
admiration, for the simple reason that human nature is
there; just as the most precious and delightful part of
home is that which is superadded by human affection.
From the high grounds above the water the outlook
is wonderfully romantic; when upon the crest of the
hill there is an inviting walk also under the trees. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the vigorous, the best part of Taxal is after all upon the
Derbyshire instead of the Cheshire side of the river,
mounting continuously for two or three miles, and so
eventually reaching Eccles Pike&mdash;a grand, green, round
hill in the middle of a huge green basin. Beyond
Whaley Bridge come in turn Doveholes and Buxton.</p>

<p>At Buxton, once the <i>El Dorado</i> of local naturalists,
the visitor finds picturesque beauty and historical associations,
even if he be not in search of the recruited health
which this celebrated old town is supposed to be always
so willing to supply. Plenty of exhilarating rambles may
be found within the compass of an afternoon, the hills
being lofty, while for those who cannot climb there is the
romantic valley of the Wye, called Ashwood Dale.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE opening of the Midland line through
Marple, like that of the L. &amp; N. W. through
Disley, was hailed with immense delight by
all lovers of country rambles. Access thereto
previously was possible only on foot, or by
canal, and in either case the journey was
rather long. Chadkirk, soon reached, is a
celebrated old village thought by some to preserve the
name of the once greatly&ndash;honoured patron&ndash;saint commemorated
also in Chadderton, Chaddock, Chatburn,
and Chat Moss; by others, to refer to one &#8220;Earl Cedda.&#8221;
Be that as it may, the tradition of the old missionary&#8217;s
once abiding here still clings to Chadkirk, and a clear
spring by the roadside, upon the left, going up the hill
near the church, and now lined with mosses, is to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
day &#8220;St. Chad&#8217;s well.&#8221; The earliest ecclesiastical notice
of the place does not occur till temp. Henry VIII. The
hill itself, Werneth Low, is one of the highest in Cheshire,
and the first of several such in that odd piece of the
county which runs away to the north&ndash;east, stretched forth,
as an old topographer says, &#8220;like the wing of an eagle.&#8221;
Like all the other eminences hereabouts, it commands
very noble and extensive views. So complete, in truth,
is the look&ndash;out in all directions from the summit, that to
walk from end to end, is like pacing a watch&ndash;tower. The
plains of Cheshire and South Lancashire lie to the west;
Lyme, Marple, and Disley are seen to the south; and
eastwards there are inviting bits of Derbyshire, here
separated from Cheshire by the Etherowe, the opposite
side charmingly clothed by the Ernocroft woods, while in
the distance rise the vast moorlands of Charlesworth and
Glossop. If bound for Werneth Low it is best, perhaps,
after all, to quit the train at Woodley, or to make our
way to that place from Parkwood. In any case, until
Werneth Low has been ascended, knowledge of our local
scenery is decidedly immature.</p>

<p>The long and beautifully wooded glen extending from
Romiley to Marple is Chadkirk Vale, and the stream,
not as some suppose, the Mersey, but the above&ndash;named
Goyt. That it is marked as the Mersey in Speed, and
again in the Ordnance map, no doubt is true. White
also calls it the Mersey,&mdash;all who do this considering that
the Mersey begins with the confluence of the Etherowe
with the Goyt, about half&ndash;a&ndash;mile below Compstall bridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
But the real point of commencing is where the Goyt is
joined by the Tame, that is to say, a little below Portwood
bridge, in the north&ndash;western suburb of Stockport.
The ramble up the vale is in every portion delightful,
closing in a deep ravine or clough called Marple Dell,
the upper extremity spanned by the three great arches of
&#8220;Marple Aqueduct.&#8221; The height of this celebrated work
from the bed of the river is nearly a hundred feet; yet,
to&ndash;day it is overtopped by the Midland viaduct, from
which, as we glide past, the dell is seen half as much
again below. Aqueducts are common enough, and so
are viaducts, but it is seldom that we have the opportunity
of contemplating at the same moment a twofold
series of arches of equal grandeur, the viaduct consisting
of no fewer than thirteen. Everywhere right and left of
the Goyt, hereabouts, there are unforbidden and usually
quiet and shady paths, some of them possibly entered
more readily by the ancient foot&ndash;roads from near Bredbury
and Hazel&ndash;grove, but all converging towards Marple
village. Three or four of the most interesting little cloughs
or dells within the same distance of Manchester are
here associated, the prettiest, perhaps, being those called
Dan&ndash;bank wood and Marple wood. Lovely strolls are at
command also by aiming for Otterspool Bridge, these
chiefly through meadows and by the rapid river, which,
when not perplexed by shifting islands and peninsulas,
decked with willow&ndash;herb and butter&ndash;bur, glides with a
stilly smoothness quite remarkable for one so shallow.
At Otterspool the rush of water is sometimes very strong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
In the olden times it was similar at Stockport, though
now subdued by the constant casting in of dirt, if there
be truth, that is, in the record that in 1745, when the
Stockport bridge was blown up in order to check the
retreat of the Pretender, it ran beneath the arches &#8220;with
great fury.&#8221; Upon the western banks of the Goyt, not
very far from Chadkirk, perched upon a romantic natural
terrace, there is another very interesting and celebrated
Elizabethan mansion, Marple Old Hall, the more
pleasing since, though subjected in 1659 to rather considerable
alterations, it appears to retain all the best of
the original characteristics. It is now draped also, in
part, with luxuriant ivy. The historical incidents connected
with Marple Hall are well known,&mdash;those, at
least, which gather round the name of Cromwell. To
our own mind there is something better yet,&mdash;the
spectacle in the earliest months of spring of the innumerable
snowdrops, these dressing the woods and slopes
with their immaculate purity, almost to the water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>Proceeding direct to Marple by the Midland, the
choicest of the many walks now at command begins with
descent of the hill upon the left, then, as soon as the
river is reached,&mdash;keeping as near it as may be practicable,&mdash;through
the lanes and meadows as far as
&#8220;Arkwright&#8217;s Mill.&#8221; No Ancoats mill is this one.
Originally called &#8220;Bottoms Mill,&#8221; it was erected in 1790
by the celebrated Mr. Samuel Oldknow, of whom so
many memorials exist in the neighbourhood, including a
lettered tablet in Marple church, and who would seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to have been associated with Arkwright in many of his
most important undertakings. The mill in question was
built, as Mr. Joel Wainwright correctly states,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> upon the
lines of the famous one at Cromford. Embosomed in a
romantic valley, and surrounded by fine trees, among
which are walnuts&mdash;for in tree&ndash;planting, as in other
things, Mr. Oldknow displayed exceptional good taste&mdash;it
gives the idea less of a cotton&ndash;mill than of some great
institute or retreat, and proves that in the country, at
least, scenes of manufacturing need not by any means be,
as usual, dep&ocirc;ts of ugliness. Soon after passing the mill,
the path continues by the river&ndash;side, through pleasant
meads and under the shadow of the trees to the point
where the stream is crossed by Windybottom Bridge,
where the hill has now to be ascended, either leftwards
for Marple Ridge and Disley, or turning to the right for
Marple village. Either way, the walk is delightful, and
always at an end too soon. Another charming way from
Arkwright&#8217;s mill to the bridge is along the slope on the
Derbyshire side of the water, called Strawberry Hill, but
this is only for the privileged. Down in this sequestered
valley, if we love the sight of wild&ndash;flowers, there is always
great store; in May the fragrant wild&ndash;anise, and in
autumn the campanula.</p>

<p>A third excellent Marple walk is to go up the hill from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the station, turn instantly to the right just above the line,
and alongside of it, and at the distance of a hundred
yards or so find our way to the bank of the canal, crossing
this and entering the fields through a stile. The path
then goes past Lea Hey farm, and after awhile past Nab
Top farm, beautiful prospects all the way. On the
right, far below, we now soon have the river, eventually
treading the meadows called Marple Dale, through
which it meanders, and at the end of which the path
mounts through the wood and enters Marple Park, the
way back to the village now self&ndash;declared.</p>

<p>After Strines, from near which place there is another
way to Cobden Edge, next, if travelling by train, we
get to New Mills, and before long to Chapel&ndash;en&ndash;le&ndash;Frith,
once again a point for new beginning, since it is here
that we start for Castleton. This is a jaunt purely for
pedestrians, and for vehicles not unwilling to linger on
the way, being one long climb, from which even steam,
that, like Lord Chatham, &#8220;tramples upon impossibilities,&#8221;
for the present seems to shrink. England furnishes few
such walks as this one from Chapel to Castleton, the
concluding part in particular, by the ancient bridle&ndash;path,
through the Windgates, or &#8220;Winnats,&#8221;&mdash;crags rising
upon each side to a height so vast that at times we seem
absolutely shut in. The hugeness and the loneliness of
this wonderful chasm, the bare grey slopes and bluffs of
projecting rock relieved only by the presence of a few
sheep, powerfully recall the great passes amid the
mountains of the distant north. Once, however, it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
have been comparatively well trodden, the Winnats, up
to about eighty years ago, having been the sole thoroughfare
from Chapel into Hope Dale. The high&ndash;road now
curls round by the foot of Mam Tor, or the &#8220;Shivering
Mountain,&#8221; so called because of the continual dribbling
away upon one side of the loose material of which this
singular pile chiefly consists. The apex of Mam Tor is
one thousand three hundred and fifty feet above the sea,
yet so great is the elevation of all the surrounding
country that it seems quite inconsiderable. Everywhere
hereabouts, in fact throughout the journey, after leaving
Chapel, a remarkable negative feature of the scenery is
the absence of water. Plenty of the little recesses are
here that remind us of those afar where moisture drips
and sparkles on green moss. But we look in vain for
the slightest trickling movement. There are none of the
little springs which ordinarily upon the mountain&ndash;side
seem longing for the time when they shall become
cascades. In Lancashire a pass like the Winnats would
have had a splashing and plentiful stream, or at all
events would remind us of a Palestine wady. It is
further remarkable that upon these hills there is no
heather, nor is there a single plant of either whortleberry
or bracken. The great attraction at Castleton consists
in the caverns. The Blue&ndash;john mine should be visited in
order to learn what stalactite drapery means; but the
best part of the &#8220;Peak&ndash;cavern&#8221; is the vestibule, open to
the daylight. Pushing into the interior, the vast altitude
of one small portion, revealed for a moment by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
fireworks, no doubt has a kind of sublimity. Still there is
nothing to please, unless it be pleasure to stand in a dark
inferno that seems no part of our own world, and which
can scarcely be entered without a feeling of dismay. The
ruins of Peveril Castle, and the fine old Norman arch in
Castleton church are both very interesting to the arch&aelig;ologist.
The position of the former is most curious, the
castle seeming from the foot of the hill to stand upon a
simple slope of turf, whereas in reality just behind it
there is an impassable abyss.</p>

<p>This inestimable line, the Midland, carries us also to
&#8220;Miller&#8217;s Dale,&#8221; from which station there is a branch at
an acute returning angle to Buxton; thence onwards to
&#8220;Monsal Dale,&#8221; Hassop, Bakewell, Rowsley, Darley, and
Matlock. Monsal Dale, <i>ipsissima</i>, has been called the
&#8220;Arcadia of the Peak.&#8221; It may be so. Remembering
the ancient and golden canon that it is the eye of the
lover that makes the beauty, the judgment may be let
stand as one that was true and just to the man who
pronounced it. The poet asks, &#8220;Who can paint like
nature?&#8221; Surely he forgot the sweet facility of the human
heart; in any case, there are no festoons like those woven
by the spirit of man. Hassop, the next in order, is the
nearest point of departure, on foot, for Chatsworth,
though Bakewell has somewhat the advantage as regards
scenery upon the way. Bakewell is the centre also for
Haddon Hall, reached thence, on foot, in half an hour.
Rowsley supplies the carriage&ndash;way to Chatsworth, and a
shady and retired walk thereto along the western side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the stream. From this point also access is easy to Lathkill
Dale, and many another of the gems of Derbyshire.
Darley Dale, with its majestic yew, one of the oldest and
grandest trees in England, and Matlock, with its mighty
Tor, are places for the longest of summer days&mdash;we can
do with no less&mdash;when the sunshine is oriental and sunset
is a kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>For a simple afternoon, there is nothing within easy
reach more delicious than Miller&#8217;s Dale itself, the significance
of which name is really the lucid and babbling
Wye, in its sweetest portion, and the unique recess which
holds Chee Tor, not to mention the pretty Wormhill
springs. The entrance to the vale is close to the station,
the path lying first through a long&ndash;extended grove of
trees, then changing to the green turf of a most beautiful
seclusion, the ground rising in pleasant slopes, smooth
except where broken by uncovered rock, while by our
side, all the way, the stream runs peacefully, circling at
times in quiet pools, or quickening in ripples that seem
to speak, the shallower parts decked with pebbles that
are covered, when the sun shines, with lacework of leaf&ndash;shadows.
The springs are at the foot of the slope where
a steep and rugged path leads to Wormhill. The water
wells out of the ground just as in the streets of a city
when some great conduit underneath has given way,
being derived, there can be no doubt, from some far&ndash;distant
original source, whence it has travelled by secret
subterranean channels. The phenomenon is in Derbyshire
by no means an uncommon one. Streams in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
several places suddenly lose themselves in the ground,
bursting out again, it may be miles away, after the manner
of the Guadalquiver;&mdash;here, at Wormhill, it appears,
nevertheless, to have its most pleasing illustration. The
Tor is found in the magnificent gorge in front, a stupendous
mass of limestone, rising vertically from the water&#8217;s
edge, with a grand curvilinear outline of nearly a quarter
of a mile in extent, the surface uniformly grey and bare,
except for scattered ivy and a few iron&ndash;like yews that are
anchored in the crevices. Upon the opposite side there
is a corresponding cliff, but less precipitous, and clothed
in every part with half&ndash;pendulous shrubs and trees. This
wonderful scene may be reached also from Ashwood
Dale, starting from Buxton, and when about half&ndash;way to
Bakewell creeping down on the left to the margin of
the stream. The path is romantic, but cannot be recommended,
being in many parts difficult and here and there
decidedly perilous.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR our present purpose it is convenient to
include, under the general title of the
North&ndash;eastern Highlands, the vast mountain
district, occupying portions of three counties,
which extends from the Peak to the neighbourhood
of Greenfield. Reached in part by
the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire system, in
part by the L. &amp; N. W. Huddersfield line, it is tolerably
well&ndash;known to travellers by those railways. They are
cognizant of it as a region of lofty moorland, bleak and
uninviting except at grouse&ndash;time. To people in general,
however, it is as strange as Norway; and no wonder,
since a visit to any one of the better portions implies a
love of adventure which, if not exceptional, is infrequent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Glorious, nevertheless, are those untouched and silent
wastes. Thousands of their acres have never felt the
ploughshare, nay, not even the spade, and probably never
will. In parts they seem to belong less to the existing
order of nature than to obsolete ages, suggesting, like the
Sahara, the idea of a former and exhausted world. Seal
Bark might be the relics of some ancient mountain, torn
to fragments when the wind whistled among the Calamites
and the Sigillarias, now nothing but bones, nameless and
immemorial.</p>

<p>The southernmost portion of this huge tract of wilderness
is occupied by Kinder Scout, the highest factor of
the Peak, the elevation being nearly two thousand feet
above the sea; and which, presenting a &#8220;broad bare
back&#8221; or plateau of fully four miles in length from east
to west, with a width of more than half as much, is
distinguishable at a glance, though often cloud&ndash;capped,
from all its neighbours. Unfortunately for the rightful
claims of massive Kinder, this great length detracts from
its majesty, since the majestic, to be appreciated, always
demands a certain amount of concentration. In substance,
like most other parts of our &#8220;north&ndash;eastern
highlands,&#8221; Kinder Scout is millstone&ndash;grit, thickly overlaid
with mountain&ndash;peat, the foothold of wiry scrub,
though, here and there presenting bold escarpments.
The surface is deeply fissured by rills of drainage&ndash;water,
and hillocks and depressions are universal. Paths cross
it in various directions, but these of course are only for
the brave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The best route, when it is desired to ascend this noble
eminence, is <i>vi&acirc;</i> Hayfield, beginning at Bowden Bridge,
and going up the valley past Farlands. It is indispensable,
however, either to be provided with a map, or
to be accompanied by a guide, as well as to take
precautions in regard to possible trespass.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Once upon
the summit, the reward is ample, alike in the magnificent
scenery, rich with distant purple shadows, and in the
inspiring atmosphere. If in the landscape there is
nothing gay and festal, no slight thing is it to stand in
the presence&ndash;chamber of these antique solitudes, reading
the silent history of centuries of winter ravage, so terrible
that no wonder the very rocks have thrust up their grey
heads to ask the meaning of it. No slight thing is it
either at any time to find ourselves beside the very urn
of a bounding and musical stream, such as trots along
the valley, this one having its birth in &#8220;Kinder Downfall&#8221;&mdash;a
far&ndash;seen shoot of water from the western cliff,
a single silver line of pretty cataract that might have
heard of Terni and the Bridal Veil, and so much the
more precious because the only one of its kind within
the distance, which is from Manchester, say precisely
twenty miles. Rain of course is needed, as at Lodore,
for the full development.</p>

<p>The writer of the &#8220;Guide&#8221; says that another very
beautiful and not infrequent spectacle to be witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
here is when in wet weather, or after a storm, the wind
blows strongly from the W.S.W. &#8220;Coming from the
direction of Hayfield, it sweeps over the Upper Moor
and the bare backs of the bleak Blackshaws, and beating
against the high flanking walls of rock is concentrated
with prodigious power into the angle of the mountain,
forcing back the whole volume of the cascade, and carrying
it up in most fantastic and beautiful lambent forms,
which are driven back again as heavy rain and mist for
half a mile across the bog, then perhaps to return to be
shivered into spray once more, unless in some momentary
lull the torrent rushes down in huge volume.&#8221; &#8220;Sometimes,&#8221;
he adds, &#8220;in winter, the fall, with the huge walls
of rock flanking its sides, becomes one mass of icy
stalactites, which as the sun declines present a magnificent
spectacle.&#8221; According to Mr. H. B. Biden, in <i>Notes
and Queries</i>, Feb. 16th, 1878, though other writers think
differently, and, as it seems to us, less reasonably, it is
to the downfall that Kinder Scout owes its name. Kin&ndash;&#40;cin&#41;&ndash;dwr&ndash;scwd,
he tells us, in Cymraeg signifies &#8220;High
water cataract.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keeping to the main line, the original &#8220;Sheffield and
Manchester,&#8221; half an hour carries us to Broadbottom
and Mottram&ndash;in&ndash;Longdendale, where we stop in order to
make acquaintance with the lively Etherowe, which here
divides Cheshire from Derbyshire, running on to Compstall,
where, as above stated, it enters the Goyt. The
scenery all the way to the point of confluence is alluring.
On the Cheshire side of the stream the slope is occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in part by Bottoms&ndash;hall Wood, through which there is a
footway to Werneth Low, and then to Hyde or Woodley,
a very pleasant sufficiency for an afternoon. On the
Derbyshire side, after crossing a few fields, Stirrup Wood
forms a beautiful counterpoise to Bottoms&ndash;hall; and
when through this we are upon Stirrup&ndash;benches, famous
for profusion of the Oreads&#8217; fern&mdash;that fragrant one so
fittingly dedicated to the nymphs who once upon a time
danced on green slopes around Diana,</p>

<p class="center">
Hinc atque hinc glomerantur Oreades.</p>

<p class="noindent">Botanists call it the <i>Lastrea Oreopteris</i>. It is well to
be reminded by them that scientific nomenclature is
something more than Greek and Latin, and a burden for
the memory, and that all the best and oldest portion of it
lies bosomed in po&euml;sy. The mythical Oreads themselves
are not required, for we have better ones in our
live companions; but of the memory of them it would be
an irreparable loss to be despoiled.</p>

<p>Above Stirrup&ndash;benches comes Ludworth Moor. Then
far away, again up above, the grand mountain&ndash;terrace
called Charlesworth Coombs, the semi&ndash;circular and denuded
face of which is in some parts very nearly perpendicular,
the ridge affording, yet once again, supreme
views. On every side there is a tumultuous sea of
mountain&ndash;crests, with intermixture of sweet green knolls,
often wooded, in the relish of which, as upon Kinder,
one thinks of the immortals in art and literature,</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>Who never can be wholly known,<br />
But still their beauty grows.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">On the contrary side are the Glossop moors; within the
valley, the thriving town after which they are named; and
the remarkably beautiful cone, covered with trees, called
Shire Hill, an isolated mound that looks as if it might
have been tossed there in pastime by the Titans.
Glossop, as every one knows, has a station of its own,
which should be remembered not only for the sake of
Shire Hill, but for Lees&ndash;hall Dingle, Ramsley Clough,
Chunal Clough, Melandra Castle, and Whiteley Nab, the
climb to the brows of which last is no doubt somewhat
arduous, but well repaid. On summer Sunday mornings,
very early, when the smoke has had time to dissolve, the
Glossop people say they can distinguish even Chester
and the sea. Ramsley Clough, a romantic defile,
apparently under the special protection of the deities
of the fountains, and the stream down which would be
more fitly designated a thousand little waterfalls, is
remarkably prolific in mosses and other green cryptogamous
plants. &#8220;Melandra Castle&#8221;&mdash;an old rampart,
with a vast quantity of stones dug out or still embedded,
is supposed, on the showing of some fragments of Roman
tiles, to date from not later than <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 500.</p>

<p>Mottram&ndash;in&ndash;Longdendale, like Charlesworth, abounds
in bold and romantic scenery, though the elevation is
much less, the height of Mottram church above the sea
being only about four hundred and fifty feet. Tintwistle
and the neighbourhood also furnish endless recreation,
as, indeed, does the whole country as far as Woodhead.
The railway runs up the valley of the Etherowe, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
river rises in the moors above, and has at this part been
converted, by barricading, into five successive <i>quasi</i>&ndash;lakes,&mdash;not
so picturesque, perhaps, as some of the other
great reservoirs we have made acquaintance with, but
still furnishing an agreeable spectacle, alike from the
train and from the hills. They contribute the chief
portion of the Manchester waterworks storage; the
collecting&ndash;grounds, which are estimated to have an
extent of nearly nineteen thousand acres, consisting
chiefly of moorland, covered, as at Kinder, with immense
sponges of mountain&ndash;peat. Retaining the rain, these
serve a purpose corresponding to that of the snows and
glaciers upon the Alps, so various are the ways in which
the munificence of nature is expressed. Mounting on
to the moors at the entrance to the Woodhead tunnel &#40;by
the brookside&#41; we presently find a clough, a waterfall,
and the beginnings of the river Derwent. Crossing the
river, as the alternative, there is a fine walk to Tintwistle,
and thence, over other seemingly boundless moors,
to Staley Brushes.</p>

<p>But now we get to a district better sought by
travel on the L. &amp; N. W. line, the long and picturesque
portion of it, that is, which runs through the Saddleworth
valley <i>en route</i> for Leeds. With the mind absorbed in
thought of the place one is bound to, or of the duties or
occupations there awaiting our arrival, the scenery right
and left of a railway often receives a very indifferent
amount of attention. The line from Ashton to Huddersfield,
excepting only the great tunnel, is one of those,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
however, which should never be used heedlessly. The
prospects are never wide&ndash;extended, for the track is
entirely through deep valleys: it is the slopes ascending
from these which are in many parts picturesque; if we
think ever so slightly of what they lead up to, they
possess the still better quality of significance.</p>

<p>In the bygones the &#8220;Brushes,&#8221; briefly so designated,
were almost as noted with the old Lancashire naturalists
as Cotterill. The ravine so called, grey crags guarding
the entrance, and a stream, with innumerable little mossy
waterfalls descending from some undiscovered fount
above, was renowned not more for its wild grandeur than
for its botany and ornithology. Now it is only historical,
the adaptation of the best part to the purposes of a
waterworks company having effaced all the leading
characteristics. The wheel&ndash;path remains much as it was,
at least above the dam, and by pursuing this, a somewhat
long ascent, we find ourselves once again upon the
moors, here called &#8220;North Britain.&#8221; Two courses
present themselves now. One is to bend to the right,
returning by way of Hollingworth; the other to strike off
sharply to the left, and after a while, descend to the
railway. The first&ndash;named supplies views of extraordinary
breadth and changefulness, extending up and across the
Tintwistle valley, and covering the hills above Dinting
and Glossop; the Hollingworth reservoirs &#40;supplementary
to those of Woodhead, and well set&ndash;off with trees,&#41;
contributing in the best manner to the power of the
landscape as a whole. The Holyngworthe family &#40;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
such is the ancient and proper spelling of the name&#41; up
to the time of the death of the last representative, had
been seated here from times anterior to the Conquest,
thus reminding one of the Traffords of Trafford Park.
The hall, a quaint relic of the past, now tenanted by
Mr. Broderick, is to a considerable extent, of temp.
Henry VI. By taking the leftward path, over the
heather, opportunity is acquired for mounting the lofty
crest, said to have been once occupied by &#8220;Bucton
Castle;&#8221; a fortress, to say the least of it, semi&ndash;fabulous,
though there is no reason to doubt that in the Armada
times, Bucton, like Alderley Edge, was used as a
signalling station. In case of need, flames shooting up
from the topmost peak, would be visible, on clear nights,
at a distance of at least twenty miles.</p>

<p>Reference was made, a page or two back, to Seal Bark.
For this we quit the line at Greenfield, first ascending
past &#8220;Bin Green&#8221; to the &#8220;Moorcock,&#8221; vulgarly &#8220;Bill&#8217;s&ndash;o&#8217;&ndash;Jack&#8217;s,&#8221;
from the heights around which the outlook
over the adjacent country is once again marvellous. Very
curious, too, and in itself well worth the climb, is the
far&ndash;seen rock &#8220;Pots and Pans,&#8221; well, if not elegantly, so
named, for on drawing near it is discovered to be an
immense mass of millstone&ndash;grit, left there since the
glacial period, with about a dozen roundish cavities upon
the top, the largest of them more than a yard across by
about fifteen inches in depth, and nine of the group
usually holding water. Local superstition, as would be
expected, attributes these singular basins to the Druids,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
who are supposed to have excavated them for ritual
purposes; but, as in other places&mdash;for such cavities are
by no means confined to Greenfield&mdash;there can be no
hesitation in regarding them as pure works of nature.
Millstone&ndash;grit is, in parts, peculiarly inadhesive. Exposed
as this rock has been for untold ages to the beating of
tempests, its softer portions, where the cavities are, have
been slowly fretted away, and we are asked to recall
nothing more than the ancient proverb. Keeping to the
road, by degrees the elevation becomes so great that
the topmost part is playfully termed the &#8220;Isle of Skye.&#8221;
It is hereabouts that the cloudberry, that most artistic
of northern fruits, never seen and unable to exist upon
lower levels, is for our own neighbourhood, so plentiful.
When ripe, so thick is the spread of rosy amber that
the spectacle is most bright and pretty, the ground
seeming strewed with white&ndash;heart cherries. Singular to
say, although very nice to human palates, the grouse
leave it untouched, turning to the whortleberry and the
cranberry.</p>

<p>As the &#8220;Druidical&#8221; origin has been popular, and lest
there may still be a lingering doubt with some as to
the natural origin of the &#8220;Pots and Pans,&#8221; it may be
added that upon the high grounds within a few miles of
Todmorden there have been reckoned up nearly eight
hundred similar cavities, the diameter varying from a few
inches to four or five feet. They may be observed indeed
in every stage of formation, thus altogether neutralizing
the idea of their having been produced by artificial means.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
They occur, moreover, only in this particular series of
the millstone&ndash;grit, other descriptions of grit in the neighbourhood&mdash;those
not so amenable to the action of the
weather&mdash;being entirely without. Very often, too, the
basins are in positions such as neither Druids or any one
else would ever select for ritual or ceremonials. The
number of basins is itself an argument against the
Druidical origin, since so many would never possibly be
required, to say nothing of the fairly determined fact
that the Druidical altar was usually a <i>cromlech</i>, formed
by placing a great slab of stone horizontally upon the
edges of two other slabs fixed in the ground vertically.</p>

<p>But we are bound for Seal Bark. To get hither, the
road must be quitted near the &#8220;Moorcock,&#8221; and a way
found through the fir&ndash;wood to the bottom of the valley,
then re&ndash;ascending by the borders of the stream. A
water so wild and beautiful it would be difficult to find
nearer than Scotland or Carnarvonshire. Sliding, gliding,
tumbling, in every conceivable mode, now it hurries along
a smooth and limpid current; now it plays with the
boulders, and changes to little cascades; now it fills
little bays and recesses with reposing foam as white as
snow, or that are alive with circular processions of
untiring bubbles that swim awhile delicately, round and
round, then, like the dancers in Sir Roger de Coverley,
when they bend beneath the arch of lifted arms, rejoin
their first partners and away down the middle, away and
away, as swift as thought. Great defiles open on the
right and left, Rimmon Clough and Birchen Clough, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the foot of which stands the one solitary tree of this
grand wilderness&mdash;a mountain&ndash;ash, the tree of all others
accustomed to loneliness. Above, at a vast height, is
Ravenstone Brow, so named from the number of birds
that once nested thereabouts, and where cuckoos still
come. When at length we arrive at Seal Bark, who
shall mistake it? All the waste and broken rock of a
kingdom seems to have been pitched over the brow,
and let fall and roll or stop just where it liked. The
probability is that at some remote period the torrent
undermined one side of the gorge, the ruins toppling
over much in the same way as those of the ancient
Clevedon shore, where it is plain that the fragments owe
their present position to the remorseless beating of the
sea.</p>

<p>For those who care to run on through the great Standedge
tunnel, three miles and sixty&ndash;four yards long, thus
getting to Marsden, there is an extremely fine mountain&ndash;pass
called Wessenden Clough, the heights on either
hand not less than a thousand feet, and once again a
rushing torrent. There is a path back to Greenfield
over the moors, but the way is rather long, except for
the practised. The great tunnel at Woodhead, upon the
Sheffield line, often thought to exceed the Standedge, is,
we may here remark, twenty yards shorter.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FORTY years ago no part of our neighbourhood
more abounded in natural attractions than
the district which comprises Moston, Blackley,
Boggart&ndash;hole Clough, Middleton, Bamford
Wood, and the upper portions generally of
the valleys of the Medlock and the Irk, the
latter including that pretty little cup amid the grassy and
tree&ndash;clad slopes still known as &#8220;Daisy Nook.&#8221; How
charmingly many of these places have been introduced
into our local literature needs no telling. Samuel
Bamford was not the man to misapprehend the beauty
of nature. Throstle Glen was one of his favourite resorts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Edwin Waugh, happily, is still with us, not alone in
perfect story, but ready with the always welcome living
voice. The spread of building and of manufacturing has
induced heavy changes in almost every portion of the
district mentioned, changes partaking, only too often, of
the nature of havoc, especially in the immediate vicinity
of the streams. So long, however, as it holds centres
of social and intellectual culture and refinement&mdash;Mr.
George Milner lives at Moston&mdash;the mind does not care
to contrast the present with the past, accepting the
record, and in that quite willing to rest. The district
in question is peculiarly interesting also from the fact of
its having been one of the principal scenes of the work
done by the old Lancashire &#8220;naturalists in humble life&#8221;
during the time that they earned their reputation. A
noted locality for hand&ndash;loom silk weaving, it was long
distinguished in particular for its resident entomologists,
the delicacy of touch demanded by that elegant art being
just that which is needed when one&#8217;s play&ndash;hours are spent
with Psyche; upon the same occupation would seem
indeed to have arisen yet another of the old characteristic
local tastes&mdash;that for the cultivation of dainty flowers,
such as the auricula and the polyanthus. Floriculture is
still pursued with fair success, though on a smaller scale;
entomology, we fear, is like the hand&ndash;loom, almost forgotten.
We should remember, also, that Alkrington
Hall, near Middleton, was the residence of the celebrated
Sir Ashton Lever, gentleman, scholar, and naturalist, and
that it was by him that the innumerable objects of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
famous Leverian Museum were brought together. While
a resident at Alkrington Hall &#40;the ancient family seat&#41; he
had the best aviary in the kingdom. In 1775 the museum
was removed to London, and ten years afterwards it was
sold by auction piecemeal. Sir Ashton&#8217;s Manchester
town house was that one in &#8220;Lever&#8217;s Row,&#8221; now called
Piccadilly, which has for many years been the &#8220;White
Bear&#8221; hotel. When he died, in 1788, this house was
advertised as eligible for a ladies&#8217; school, being so far
away from the centre of business, and fields within a few
yards!</p>

<p>&#8220;White Moss,&#8221; as before&ndash;mentioned <a href="#Page_60">&#40;p. 60&#41;</a>, has long
since been converted into farm&ndash;land, but in the days
referred to was still in its glory, dull to look at, no doubt,
but to the interrogator a local garden of Eden. Never
shall we forget the genial smile that rippled old George
Crozier&#8217;s broad, round, rosy, white&ndash;fringed face as one
sunny afternoon in Whitsun&ndash;week, 1839, we stepped with
twenty or more under his guidance for the first time upon
the elastic peat, and beheld the andromeda and the pink
stars of the cranberry, these also for the first time. To
Crozier the pretty flowers were familiar as the hills; his
joy was to watch the delight they gave the juveniles.
Presently a man came up and asked if we were &#8220;looking
for <i>brids</i>.&#8221; A little puzzled at first by the strange inquiry,
the mystery was soon solved by his taking off his hat and
showing it stuck full of butterflies, the &#8220;birds,&#8221; or in
his homely Anglo&ndash;Saxon, the &#8220;brids&#8221; caught during his
ramble. Among the more remarkable insects then to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
captured on White Moss were the showy beetle called
<i>Carabus nitens</i>, the glittering green stripes of its wing&ndash;cases
edged with a band of brilliant copper&ndash;colour; the
fox&ndash;moth, <i>Lasiocampa rubi</i>, so called from its peculiar
foxy colour; and the emperor&ndash;moth, <i>Saturnia pavonia</i>, for
which the moss had been from time immemorial a noted
locality. Great has been the sport of many an entomologist,
as, sitting on White Moss on a fine day in early
summer, with a captured virgin female of this beautiful
creature, the <i>antenn&aelig;</i> of which are like ostrich plumes,
the males have flocked to him, or rather to <i>her</i>, by the
hundred, for the virgin female of the emperor&ndash;moth,
though she can fly, prefers to sit still until she has been
visited by an individual of the other sex. Up to this
period she exudes a delicate odour which attracts the
latter from long distances, those which have far to come,
and arrive late, or not till after the advent of the first,
turning back, unless captured by the entomologist&#8217;s net,
as soon as they perceive by their wonderful instinct that
she is virgin no longer. The wings of the males, as
with most other kinds of butterfly, are rarely found perfect,
except when first fledged. Flying about in ardent search
of the female, they tear and chip them against the heath
and other plants with which they come in contact through
their impatience. The plant that chiefly attracted attention
on that memorable day was the cotton&ndash;sedge, the
most beautiful production of the moorlands, and conspicuous
from afar as its silvery&ndash;white tassels bend and
recover before the breeze. Carrying off a great handful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
&#8220;Look!&#8221; said the rural children in the lanes, amazed
that any one could care for such rubbish, &#8220;there&#8217;s a
man been getting moss&ndash;crops!&#8221; All the mosses about
Manchester produce the cotton&ndash;sedge, but never have we
seen such luxuriant specimens as in the ditches that were
then being cut for the draining of White Moss. Three
species occur, the broad&ndash;leaved, the narrow&ndash;leaved, and
the single&ndash;flowered, the tufts of the latter being upright
instead of pendulous. Their beauty, unhappily, is their
only recommendation, for the herbage is rough and coarse,
and altogether unfit for pasture, and the cotton, so called,
is cotton only in name. It cannot be manufactured; the
hairs are too straight and too brittle. Instead of twining
and entangling, like the filaments of true cotton, they lie
rigidly side by side, resembling true cotton merely in
their whiteness, and could no more be spun into yarn
than slate&ndash;pencils could be twisted into a cable.</p>

<p>Boggart&ndash;hole Clough, a little nearer Manchester, was
reached most readily at the time spoken of, and of course
is so still, by way of Oldham Road, going by omnibus
or tram&ndash;car as far as the end of the first lane carried over
the railway. There are plenty of roads <i>under</i> arches
formed by the railway, but these will not do; it must be the
first that goes <i>over</i> the embankment. Crossing the line at
the point in question, a descending path presently brings
us to Jack&#8217;s Bridge, a sweet little dell, consecrated by one
of nature&#8217;s own poets, then a resident at Newton Heath:</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>Jack&#8217;s Bridge! thy road is rough,<br />
But thy wild&ndash;flowers are sweet!</p></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Other fields gradually lead on towards Moston, several of
them containing large &#8220;pits,&#8221; or ponds, where, in July
the white water&ndash;lily may be seen in its lustrous bloom,
and the Comarum, covered with its deep&ndash;red blossoms
and ripening fruit; and from there the way is easily
found into the clough, which is entered about the middle.
On the left, from this point, there is an enticing field&ndash;path
by the side of the stream to the Blackley road; on the
right we mount into the sylvan part, and see for ourselves
how well merited is the reputation of this once&ndash;affrighting
haunt of the boggart. All the charms of a leafy and
flowery solitude are there assembled. Not those of the
old, old forest, perfect in forest&ndash;ways, these we must not
look for; but of the gentle ravine, wherein we cannot be
lost, and which often pleases so much the more because
less grand, since in all things while it is the great and
sublime that we <i>admire</i>, that which we <i>love</i> is the little
and measurable. Beautiful trees are here, that among
their boughs give ever&ndash;pleasing glimpses of soft scenery,
and in its season, white patches of bridal May,</p>

<p class="center small">
The milk&ndash;white thorn that scents the evening gale,
</p>

<p class="noindent">and that never hinder the sight of the azure overhead;
and if while pushing our way through the brown remains
of last year&#8217;s ferns, brambles with their long arms and
claws always seeking to clutch at the traveller, insist on
plucking off one&#8217;s cap just to show that the way is &#8220;on
sufferance;&#8221; well, never mind, a lively little rill running
in parts through beds of wild mint makes a pleasant
noise, and wherever a sparkle is wanted to relieve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
still and motionless, a silver eye or a glittering rapid is
not awanting. Of course we must take with us a disposition
to enjoy. &#8220;A song,&#8221; says some author, &#8220;is
thrown away that is not in the same key as the listener.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clough is not distinguished by anything special in
the way of plants, though we have gathered there fine
sprigs of the sweet woodruff. As a retreat, however,
from the noise and bustle of the town, and the only place
of the kind in that direction, it must always be precious
to the lover of nature. Unfortunately, the path has of
late years become very much disturbed through the
falling away of the bank, the steepness of which, and the
weight of the trees, unprovided with sufficient anchorage
by reason of the lightness of the soil, causes continual
landslips, so that now there are in many places rather
dangerous declivities. Many of the trees that once stood
erect upon the brows, now lie ingloriously with their
heads in the brook beneath, and their roots in the air.
The increase of buildings about Newton and Failsworth,
and the consequent incessant raids of destroying boys,
have also tended of late years to mar the place considerably;
and now, in 1882, it has to be said with deep
regret, that the regular Sunday resort to Boggart&ndash;hole of
the lowest roughs of the neighbouring villages, leaves it
for the week&ndash;day visitor tattered and torn and soiled
beyond recovery. The signal, with every new season,
for renewed mischief, is the opening of the golden
sallow&ndash;bloom, now not a tenth in quantity of what it was
even in 1850. These roughs are the thousand times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
more affrighting boggarts of to&ndash;day, masters, permittedly
by the authorities, of a place once another Kelvin Grove,</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>Where the wild rose in its pride<br />
Paints the hollow dingle side,<br />
And the midnight fairies glide,<br />
<span class="add4em">Bonnie lassie, O!</span></p></div>

<p>We have spoken of Boggart&ndash;hole Clough in conformity
with the generally current idea, namely, that in the olden
time it was a haunt or habitation of &#8220;boggarts.&#8221; Boggart&ndash;<i>hole</i>
is thought by some to be a mistaken and enlarged
spelling of Boggart <i>Hall</i>, the appellation of a house near
the head of the clough, once and for a long while of evil
repute as the home of an unclean spirit. Samuel Bamford
seems to favour the popular conception, probably because
unwilling to disturb it, though he himself never hints at
the existence in this clough of any particular uncanny
inmate. The boggart of the hall was no other, it is
further contended, than the &#8220;brownie&#8221; found in some
shape or other all the world over, superstitions of this
character being co&ndash;extensive with human nature, sometimes
vulgarized, sometimes exquisitely etherialised, and
taking as many forms as there are powers of fancy in the
human mind. The pixies of Devonshire and Titania&#8217;s
&#8220;Sweet Puck&#8221; belong to the poetical line of thought;
the ugly and mischievous &#8220;boggarts&#8221; to the rustic one.
The entire subject has been dealt with by Harland and
Wilkinson in the <i>Lancashire Folk&ndash;lore</i>. The legend is
also given in the <i>Traditions of Lancashire</i>, the compiler
of which would seem to have adopted an earlier version<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in the <i>Literary Gazette</i> for 1825. There is yet another
surmise, that &#8220;boggart&#8221; in this particular instance is a
mistake for &#8220;Bowker,&#8221; a family of which name is said
to have once occupied the hall. Possibly. Admitting
either explanation to be the true one and finally
established, the received idea still goes abreast of that
beautiful old tendency of the universal human heart to
assign spiritual beings to every part of physical nature,
the basis of all the primitive religions, and which will
endure when etymology is dead. Mrs. Banks supplies
yet another version, referring us to the time of Prince
Charles Edward, the Pretender, one of whose unfortunate
followers was constrained to hide himself in the clough,
friends who were in the secret giving out, in order to
hinder search by the enemy, that the place of refuge was
the abode of demons.</p>

<p>The path through the fields referred to as the best for
approaching the clough from Manchester, turns up when
near Blackley through a little wood, and thence into
meadows, which very agreeably abridge the distance
homeward, especially if we go at that best season of all
for visiting Boggart&ndash;hole, when the newly&ndash;cut hay is
scenting the air, and tiny hands are trying to help the
great rakes and forks of the farmer&#8217;s troop, and the
beautiful crescent of the young moon hangs golden in
the sky, and the bright reluctant twilight almost lasts to
another day, lingering like a lover at the hand of his
betrothed. The stream, it may be added, that winds
its way along the bottom of the clough is a tributary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the Irk,&mdash;that unfortunate little river which, rising in or
near tree&ndash;crested Tandle Hill, north&ndash;east of Middleton,
seems to grow ashamed of its blackened waters as it
creeps into the town by Collyhurst, and which, as it
hastens to its oblivious refuge in the Irwell, is known to
every one in its last leap,&mdash;the hideous fall underneath
the Victoria Station, on the side next Millgate. &#8220;Manchester
Rivers, their Sources and Courses,&#8221; would form a
capital subject for a book. The Mersey, the Irwell, the
Irk, the Tame, the Etherowe, the Bollin, the Goyt, and
several others, are full of interesting associations; and if
they be not of the clearest water in their lower portions,
remember the work they do. A limpid stream among
the hills is lovely and poetical; but the most pleasing of
all rivers are those of which the banks are occupied by
an industrious and intelligent population; and we must
not cry out too vehemently about the soiling and spoiling,
unless it be easily avoidable and a piece of downright
and wilful damage, when their first and highest value is
that of facilitating industrial efforts, and helping on the
prosperity of a town and nation. The truly poetical man
is never a sentimentalist; and though he may pity the
destruction of beautiful objects, he is content to see them
converted into sources of general welfare, and to look
elsewhere for new materials of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Bamford Wood is a cluster of leafy dells or dingles,
reached, in the first instance, by going to Heywood, the
rather tedious and uninteresting streets of which have to
be pursued till we come to &#8220;Simpson Clough.&#8221; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
dells are disposed in the form of a V, the upper extremities
again forked, and feathering away until at last they
merge into fields. Down every dell comes a stream,
rushing over large stones, the various waters all meeting
eventually in the angle of the V, and soon afterwards
swelling the river Roche, which in turn flows into the
Irwell not far from Radcliffe. The various portions
have all their distinctive names, &#8220;Dobb&ndash;wood,&#8221; upon the
left, holds &#8220;Cheeseden&ndash;brook.&#8221; Beyond this we have
Windy&ndash;cliff&ndash;wood, Carr&ndash;wood and Jowkin&ndash;wood; while
upon the right are Ashworth&ndash;wood and Bamford&ndash;wood,
emphatically so called. The stream descending the
latter is Norden&ndash;water. Exact routes through these
pretty glades it is impossible to prescribe, so much must
depend upon personal taste and leisure. The extent, the
beauty, and the wildness, require in truth many visits to
be appreciated. There is more than one round natural
lawn in the curves of the stream, where the silence has
often been broken by pic&ndash;nics and music. Most parts
may be trodden dry&ndash;shod, but it is well always to reckon
upon four or five miles and a few adventures. All ladies
who go the entire circuit deserve to be commended as
Bamford heroines.</p>

<p>Not to leave the way altogether undescribed, the best
mode of procedure upon arrival at Simpson Clough is
perhaps, soon after entering, to ascend the path among
the trees upon the left, then into some fields and to the
edge of a precipice, from which a view is obtained of a
considerable portion of the wood, where an idea may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
formed of the route it may be pleasantest now to follow.
No part is uninteresting; the question is simply where to
begin. Compared with the warm glades of Cheshire,
Bamford Wood is upon the average quite a fortnight
later in escaping from winter. Spring&#8217;s &#8220;curled darlings&#8221;
have already stepped into the green parlours of the
Bollin valley, while up here a leaf is scarcely open; even
the palm&ndash;willow, elsewhere always ready for the earliest
April bee, is cautious and dilatory. The most interesting
plant of the wood is the <i>Rubus saxatilis</i>, which, though
found nowhere else in the neighbourhood of Manchester,
is abundant near Coal&ndash;bank Bridge, but very seldom
flowers. On some of the cliffs, at a tantalizing height,
just out of reach of the longest arm, grows that beautiful
sylvan shrub the Tutsan, <i>Hypericum Andros&aelig;mum</i>. The
sides of the glen are in most parts lofty and steep, clothed
with trees, and often decorated with little waterfalls, while
the bed of the stream itself is so rugged that the wood
after much rain is filled with the sound of its hindered
efforts to escape. On emerging from the wood, at the
upper extremity, or furthest from Simpson Clough, there
is a fine walk over Ashworth Moor to Bury, from which
place also it may be approached.</p>

<p>In 1839 there was no &#8220;Lancashire and Yorkshire
Railway.&#8221; Now by its help we reach the beautiful sheet of
water called, popularly, &#8220;Hollingworth <i>Lake</i>,&#8221; but which,
like the water at Lymm, Rudyard, and Taxal, is really
no more than a reservoir, constructed about seventy years
ago to supply, in part, the Rochdale and Manchester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Canal. The circumference, which is very irregular,
exceeds two miles. Rising high upon every side, the
encircling hills have a wild and rugged grandeur that
contrasts most agreeably with the smooth and tender
beauty of the environments of the meres of Cheshire,&mdash;from
their summits, upon a sunny afternoon, the effects
are quite as pleasing as the average of those gathered
above Ullswater. An obelisk upon the highest point
marks Whiteley Dean, the view from which is wonderfully
fine, reaching southwards to Manchester; while
beyond Littleborough, amid great piles of hills, stands
Brown Wardle, famous, like Bucton Castle, as an ancient
signal station. Amid them is a mamelon quite equal in
graceful outline to Shutlings Low, and decidedly taking
precedence of the more familiar one called Rivington
Pike, since the latter, when looked for at particular
angles, disappears; whereas the Brown Wardle mound
keeps fairly true to its outline from whatever point
observed, at all events upon the southern side. The
best view of it, so far as we know, is obtained from near
&#8220;Middleton Junction.&#8221; As the word &#8220;mamelon&#8221; does
not occur in English dictionaries, it may be well to
say that it denotes a smooth, round, evenly&ndash;swelling
eminence, thrown up from amid hills already high, a
feature in mountain scenery greatly admired by the
ancient Greeks, who gave it a name of precisely similar
signification, as in the case of that classic one at Samos
which Callimachus connects so elegantly with the name
of the lady Parthenia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Moving along the western borders of the lake, it is
impossible for the eye not to catch sight of some curious
projecting crags upon the topmost crest of the highest
ground in front. These are the noted &#8220;Robin Hood
Rocks&#8221; of the legend, the lofty hill upon which they are
perched being Blackstone Edge itself, with, just below
them, the remains of the still more famous Roman road.
That Littleborough stands on the site of an ancient
Roman station is well known. The road mounted the
steep slope, crossed it, and then descended into Yorkshire,
running as far as the city where Severus died. By
reason, it would seem, of the extreme steepness, the
construction is different from that of any other Roman
road in the country, there being a deep groove along the
middle of the accustomed pavement, designed apparently
with the help of proper wheels to steady the movement
of heavily laden trucks. In any case, there is not a more
interesting scene near Manchester than is supplied upon
the slopes of this grand range&mdash;Blackstone Edge&mdash;which
if unpossessed of the drear wildness of mighty Kinder,
is solaced by the placid bosom of distant Hollingworth.
Two ways give access. We may ascend either from the
margin of the water, proceeding through fields and the
little glen called Clegg&#8217;s Wood; or from Littleborough
by the turnpike&ndash;road, turning off when about half&ndash;way up
to the right, and then mounting again. At the height of
about a quarter of a mile the road will be discovered&mdash;a
belt of massive pavement, about forty feet in width,
quite smooth, and overgrown with whortle and crowberry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
except in parts where these have been cleared away with
a view to minute examination of the stone&ndash;work. So
bright is the colour of this heathy covering, compared
with that of the general vegetation of the hill, that when
the atmosphere is clear, and the sunshine favourably
subdued, the road may be plainly discerned from the
opposite side of the valley, a regular and well&ndash;defined
streak of green. Arrived at the summit, a few yards
over the level brow, we find the boundary&ndash;stone between
the two counties, and from this point may trace the road
for some distance onwards.</p>

<p>Running on, past Rochdale and through the tunnel,
again there is a quite new sphere of enjoyment in the
country which lies on the northern side of the Todmorden
valley, everywhere picturesque, and constantly branching
into subordinate valleys with never&ndash;silent streams. The
finest of them are the Burnley valley and the vast and
romantic defile called, as a whole, Hardcastle Crags,
though this name applies strictly to no more than the
singular insulated masses of rock at the upper extremity
or beyond the bridge. A more charming resort for two&ndash;thirds
of a day the West Riding scarcely offers. The
path is first through the so called &#8220;streets,&#8221; at an angle
of forty&ndash;five degrees, that lead towards Heptonstall, then
along the crest of the hill until the point is reached for
descending through the wood, at the foot of which, if
the water be low enough, the stream may be crossed by
stepping&ndash;stones. Clinging to them will be found in plenty
that curious aquatic moss the <i>Fontinalis antipyretica</i>, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
named by Linn&aelig;us in reference to the use which he says
it was put to by the peasantry in Sweden. Possessed of
properties so much the more singular from their occurrence
in a water&ndash;plant, the country people, he tells us,
were accustomed to use it to fill up the spaces between
the chimneys and the walls of their houses, so as to
exclude the air and serve as a protection against fire.
The wood is in many parts quite a little natural fernery.
We have on various occasions seen no fewer than five
different species all growing so near together that they
could be touched without moving a single step&mdash;the
common shield&ndash;fern, the broad&ndash;leaved sylvan shield&ndash;fern,
the hard&ndash;fern, the oak&ndash;fern, and the beech&ndash;fern. Oak&ndash;fern,
<i>Polypodium Dryopteris</i>, is a frequent inhabitant of
the dells hereabouts where moist, growing in patches
more than a foot across.</p>

<p>Like the rocks of Whaley Bridge, Kinder Scout,
Greenfield, and Seal Bark, those of the Hebden valley
consist of millstone&ndash;grit, alternating with shale, the latter
cropping out chiefly along the course of the river. It
was among these shales, though perhaps more particularly
in portions laid bare during the construction of the
line along the main or Todmorden valley, that Samuel
Gibson, the once celebrated blacksmith&ndash;naturalist of
Hebden Bridge, pursued his researches in connection
with fossil shells, as described in the first volume of the
<i>Transactions of the Manchester Geological Society</i> &#40;1841&#41;.
His work is said, in the volume in question, to have been
carried on in &#8220;High Green Wood,&#8221; and as regards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
common use of this name, correctly so, as it is applied
very generally to the entire valley, or from the village up
to the insulated rocks. Properly, however, it denotes only
a small portion near the latter. Gibson, a man wholly
self&ndash;taught, and who kept to his anvil till nearly the time
of his death, in the spring of 1849, possessed a vast
amount of knowledge of almost every department of
natural history. A considerable portion of his collection,
comprising a cabinet of seeds of British plants, ferns,
lichens, Marchantias, shells, and insects, was purchased,
after his decease, for the Peel Park Museum. Another
portion went to the museum once existing in Peter&ndash;street.
The herbarium of flowering plants, valued at &pound;75, went
into the hands of Mr. Mark Philips. Most men suffer
from some kind of constitutional malady. Poor Gibson
laboured under an infirmity of temper which constantly
brought him into collision with his fellow&ndash;students. He
always meant well, as proved in his last famous battle
over the <i>Carex paradoxa</i>; and probably had his life
been a less lonely one the roughness would have got
smoothened, and he would have been as friendly with all
other men as with the writer of this little notice, which
is intended rather to preserve the memory of a singularly
acute and industrious observer of nature, working single&ndash;handed,
in the face of enormous difficulties, than to
imply the least reflection on his tendency to warfare.
The distance of Gibson&#8217;s home, twenty&ndash;four miles of
coach&ndash;road, prevented his often coming to Manchester;
but no man was ever more welcome. How different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
some of those he came among! As for old Crozier,
whose name we have already mentioned two or three
times, and whose work was so largely identified with
White Moss, Boggart&ndash;hole Clough, and Bamford&ndash;wood,
in temper and disposition he was Gibson&#8217;s completest
antithesis. No man has ever done more, in his own
circle, to foster and diffuse the love of nature and of
natural science&mdash;accomplishing this, as Crozier did, not
so much through the variety and exactitude of his knowledge,
as through the urbanity of his manner. Few are
now living who remember Crozier; it may be allowed,
therefore, to repeat what we said of him in 1858, wishing
only that space would allow of an ample biography,
since, although not a life of stirring incident, it was one
of generous and unsophisticated good example. When
first acquainted with him, the year after the accession of
Her Majesty, he was curator of the Museum of Natural
History then possessed by the Mechanics&#8217; Institution,
and distinguished for his skill as a bird&ndash;stuffer, though
his occupation by day, and up to six p.m., was that of
a master saddler. The chief portion of that excellent
collection, long since unhappily sold off, had been accumulated
by the earliest of the Manchester Field Natural
History Societies&mdash;a band of zealous, practical men who
had associated themselves, in 1829, for the furtherance of
botany, entomology, ornithology, and the allied sciences.
The register of names includes those of the celebrated
Edward Hobson, whose volumes of moss&ndash;books are contained
in our Free Libraries, of Rowland Detrosier, of all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
indeed, of the earnest scientific men of the time, Crozier
of course in the front. They called themselves the
&#8220;Banksians,&#8221; and had regular indoor meetings up to
1836, when, owing to the loss of many members,
Edward Hobson, the president, in particular, who died
that year, there came a lull, and eventually a break&ndash;up.
But Crozier was alive: that was enough; no world is ever
so drowned but some little Ark floats on the surface of the
waters; younger men arrived on the scene, the Directors
of the Institution gave them every encouragement in
their power, and in less than eighteen months the celebrated
old Cooper&ndash;street &#8220;Natural History Class&#8221; came
into existence. At intervals there were delightful evening
meetings of the character, though less pretentious, that
now&ndash;a&ndash;days are called <i>soir&eacute;es</i>,&mdash;more than once under the
presidentship of the late Mr. James Aspinall Turner,
always a warm and liberal patron of natural history;
honoured also by the presence of visitors from Preston,
Halifax, Warrington, and other towns from which the
journey was then possible only by whip. After coffee
had been served short essays were read, and from nine
o&#8217;clock until half&ndash;past ten or so the company promenaded,
examining the curiosities in the glass cases that covered
the wall or those laid out upon the tables, and enjoying
the social pleasure which grows so largely out of consociation
based upon a definite and intelligent idea, and
where there is plenty to feast the eye. No man entered
more thoroughly into the spirit of these gatherings than
George Crozier. They were his festivals and harvest&ndash;homes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
prepared for long beforehand, and looked back
upon as isles of light and verdure in his wake. His love
of social gatherings, his skill as a practical naturalist,
were equalled by his sagacity and shrewdness. &#8220;There,&#8221;
said he once, on the conclusion of the reading of a
paper, &#8220;that is what we want; that wasn&#8217;t learnt out of
a book.&#8221; His courtesy and generosity rose to the same
level. Every Tuesday evening, when the members of the
class assembled to compare their notes and discoveries
of the past week, there was old Crozier, busy as usual
with his birds, and only too glad to chat with his young
disciples, withholding nothing he could tell that would
interest and amuse, and, what was far more valuable,
inspiring them with his own enthusiasm. This kind,
warm&ndash;hearted, cheerful old man it was who, taking the
young naturalists by the hand, first showed many of them
the way to Baguley and to Carrington, to Greenfield and
to Rostherne, pointing out the rarities which his large
experience knew so cleverly how to find, and communicating
his various knowledge with the unselfishness of
one in a thousand. Nothing seemed to come strange to
him. Great as was his botanical information, he excelled
in a still higher degree as an entomologist and ornithologist;
he was acquainted with the shape and habits
of every bird and every butterfly, every branch of his
knowledge helping him to enlarged success in the prosecution
of the others, botany aiding entomology, and
entomology facilitating botany. It was his extensive
and accurate knowledge of plants that rendered him so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
expert in finding rare insects, being aware what species
the latter feed upon, and familiar with their forms. He
showed, in the highest degree, how happy a man can
make himself by the study of natural history, however
humble his station in life, and however confining his
employment. For Crozier, like all the rest of the old
Lancashire naturalists, got his living, as already indicated,
by manual labour, exercised in a shop on Shudehill, the
last place in the world one would look to for the abode
of a naturalist, yet made by his intelligent pastimes one
of the most contented in Manchester. Here we have
looked over his dried plants, his choice exotics given him
by friendly gardeners, examined his birds and shells, and
listened while he told his adventures &#8220;by flood and field.&#8221;
Of such he was always ready with large store, being, as an
old Banksian associate reminds me, in a letter of pleasant
anecdote and reminiscence, &#8220;one of those plain, plodding,
practical naturalists, whose knowledge the field and
forest, the uplands and the watery cloughs, had far more
contributed to give than the lore of books.&#8221; * * *
&#8220;The quiet, unromantic study of books,&#8221; he continues,
&#8220;would never have made either him or them what they
were. Active adventure, real life within the whole
domain of nature, was their condition of enjoyment;
and, consequently, the secluded footpaths, the fine old
green and lonely lanes, the umbrageous bosky dell, with
its clear babbling brook, and rich with plants, insects,
and minerals, were their haunts.&#8221; In all his excursions
he was joined by from three to a dozen of his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in the love of science and nature; it should
rather be said, perhaps, that he was generally one of
every party made up by the naturalists of the day for the
purpose of visiting the country, as there was but a single
purpose among the whole. One of his warmest friends
was Thomas Townley, originally of Blackburn, where
the two men became acquainted, subsequently of Liverpool,
and eventually of our own city. The circumstance
is worth mentioning on two accounts. Next to a man&#8217;s
acts and principles, it is interesting to know who were
his closest and oldest associates, since there is always a
reciprocal though unconscious influence passing from one
to the other, which explains a good deal of character; and
in the second place, in addition to being an excellent
botanist, Townley was a neat painter in water&ndash;colours,
and claimed, with a justice that is most willingly acknowledged,
the credit of drawing forth the youthful genius
of his friend&#8217;s son, the Robert Crozier of to&ndash;day. It is
pleasant to think that the beautiful pictures which now
decorate so many walls had their impulse in the little
palette of the old botanist. Townley and Crozier were
the first to design a &#8220;Manchester Flora,&#8221; and but for
Crozier&#8217;s infirm health during the latter years of his life,
the crude catalogue of 1840 would have been followed
by a complete work, in which his own long observations
and those of the other leading botanists of the district
would have been consolidated. Crozier died before he
could do the part intended. Townley, however, never
let go the idea, and two years after Crozier&#8217;s death his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
zeal and willingness as wielder of the &#8220;pen of the ready
writer,&#8221; and his wonderful memory for poetry, which
here had congenial exercise, appeared in the work commonly
known as &#8220;Buxton&#8217;s Guide.&#8221; So much poetry
had Townley ready for introduction into it, that the
useful and accurate little volume in question might
easily have been swelled to double the size.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Townley
could recite passages from any part of Pope&#8217;s Homer,
and such was his admiration of that poem, that he
repeatedly declared if he had his younger days before
him he would learn Greek in order to peruse it in the
original.</p>

<p>It may be added, in reference to Crozier, who was a
well&ndash;built, portly man, quiet but merry, fond of a joke
and a good story, mild and gentle, yet thoroughly
independent, that his long and upright life, rejoiced by
hearty and abiding love of nature, and the respect of
every one who truly knew him, closed in 1847. He died
in Peel&ndash;street, Hulme, on Friday, the 16th of April, and
was interred at the Harpurhey Cemetery on the following
Tuesday. Never was there a better example of the
scientific man in humble life, or of the practical kind&ndash;heartedness
and generosity that spring from simple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
God&ndash;fearing virtue. His old friend, Townley, survived
him ten years, coming to his own end September 9th,
1857.</p>

<p>The old Banksian minute&ndash;books and other records and
illustrations of the work of fifty years ago have, very
fortunately, been preserved, and are now in the safe
keeping of their proper inheritor. No written memorials
of the Natural History class are extant, but four or five
of the original members still venerate the name of their
ancient leader.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MERE Clough! Where is that? Such
will probably be the reception of our
present title, at least in thought, by not
a few of those whom we hope to be the
means of introducing to this romantic
little glen. For it is positively surprising
how much of the rural beauty of our neighbourhood is
unknown, even to those who delight in country scenes
and the fresh air of the fields; and how often the very
existence of it is unsuspected till some fortunate accident
brings home the welcome truth. Nowhere within the
same very short distance of Manchester is so much
woodland beauty to be found as in Mere Clough and its
immediate neighbourhood; nor is any place within four
miles of the Cathedral the avenue to so many pleasant
auxiliary walks. In botanical riches Mere Clough is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
second nearly to Bowdon, over which place it has the
advantage of its earliest plants being among the rare
ones of the Manchester flora, while its latest are some
of the most beautiful and attractive. The name of
&#8220;clough,&#8221; though so familiar in Lancashire, is not known
in the southern counties. Hence it may be useful to
observe that &#8220;cloughs,&#8221; beyond the Mersey, are those
fissures or &#8220;clefts&#8221; in the ground which give the first and
simplest idea of a valley. Formed by the rise, in opposite
directions, of two gentle acclivities, which run for a short
distance in a more or less irregular and winding parallel,
and at last widely diverge, or else undulate away into the
plain, these &#8220;cloughs&#8221; have in every case a little stream
along the bottom, while the slopes on either side are
clothed with trees and natural shrubbery. Along the
borders of the stream there is a slender rustic path, which
often quits the water&ndash;side to mount high upon the slope,
and thus give pretty little peeps of the shining current
down below and of the distant leafy intricacies of the
wood. Rarely is there so much water as to form a deep
and steady brook; in summer&ndash;time we may be sure it
will be shallow enough to &#8220;make music to the enamelled
stones,&#8221; and beguile us onward with that beautiful magic
which always accompanies the artless voices and tones of
nature.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In the neighbourhood of Prestwich there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
several such cloughs, the &#8220;Dells&#8221; below the church
being the nearest and best known, and Mere Clough the
longest and most romantic. The others are Hurst
Clough, to the west of Stand, and Agecroft Clough, near
the bridge of that name. All these cloughs bear more
or less directly towards the Irwell, into which river their
little streamlets convey themselves. The beauty of Prestwich
Dells has long rendered the latter place a favourite
resort. Easy, moreover, of access, and with the capital
recommendation of a harbour of refuge close at hand, in
the shape of the commodious and well provided Church
Inn, no wonder that few except naturalists have cared to
push on farther. It needs something more than invites
people to a place like Prestwich Dells to take us to one
still prettier, but where, as far as concerns supplies for
the inner man, we are like sailors on the open sea&mdash;commanding
only what we carry thither.</p>

<p>The conveyance to go by, should the walk be thought
too long, is the Whitefield omnibus. About three&ndash;quarters
of a mile beyond Prestwich, through which village the
omnibus passes, there is an old&ndash;fashioned &#8220;magpie&#8221; upon
the left. Leave the omnibus here, and, going through
the farmyard, follow the path through the field, keeping
to the right of the new asylum, and in a few minutes the
entrance to the clough will come in view. At first, the
path is near the summit of the slope; afterwards it crosses
the stream, and continues the rest of the way at the
bottom. If we please, when half&ndash;way through, we may
re&ndash;ascend &#40;this time to the top of the northern slope&#41;, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
going through the field upon the right, to where the great
arches support the roadway, and so find our way by the
carriage&ndash;track which leads to &#8220;The Park,&#8221; the residence
of Mr. R. N. Philips, and eventually through the private
lodge&ndash;gate at the extremity, there emerging on to the
public path by the reservoir, at nearly the same point that
is reached by the lower one. The latter course has the
advantage of preserving the feet dry, should the path
by the stream be deceitful, as often happens after wet
weather, and also of providing views of the surrounding
country, but the lower path is considerably more
romantic. The private grounds are exceedingly pretty
and sylvan, and up to about half a century ago were used
as pheasant&ndash;preserves. Like those at Norcliffe, they are
not forbidden to legitimate and respectful request made
a few days previously, with the understanding that there
shall be no trowels carried.</p>

<p>As stated in our second chapter, Mere Clough is fertile
in curious plants. In every part there is abundance in
particular of that beautiful reminder of pre&ndash;adamite
vegetation, the sylvan horsetail, in scientific language
<i>Equisetum sylvaticum</i>, in form resembling a tiny larch
tree, the leaves, which are no longer or stouter than a
violet stalk, curving outwards and downwards in the most
graceful way imaginable, and forming a succession of
little cupolas up the stem which they encircle. Varying
from a few inches to nearly two feet in height when
mature, and of a singularly delicate green, sometimes it
tapers off to a point, sometimes is crowned with a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of miniature fir&ndash;cone, which serves at once for flower and
seed&ndash;pod, and will well repay minute examination. When
ripe, an impalpable green powder dusts out of this little
cone&ndash;like body, every particle a distinct and living seed,
and originating a new plant, if not destroyed before it
can germinate. Under the microscope, these particles
perform most amusing evolutions. It is merely necessary
that some one breathe upon them while we observe, to
make every little atom twist and entangle its long arms
as if it were an animated creature. A magnifying power
of sixty is quite sufficient to show these curious movements,
and the seeds, if preserved in a pill&ndash;box, will keep
good for many years. All the neighbouring dells and
groves likewise contain this charming plant, and growing,
as it often does, in large patches, we seem to have woods
within woods. Hurst Clough, best reached from Molyneux
Brow, noted also for the <i>Rosa villosa</i>, is one of the
richest. Not that it is confined to them, being more or
less diffused in most directions out of Manchester, but
it is here that it grows most plentifully and luxuriantly.
Contemporaneous with the sylvan horsetail, there comes
a second kind of golden saxifrage. The common sort
was mentioned when describing Ashley meadows. This
one, scientifically called the <i>alternifolium</i>, is larger and
handsomer, as well as rare, and is to be gathered on
the left hand borders of the stream, just after passing the
white cottage in the middle of the clough. Another plant
of special interest, and blooming at the same time, is the
mountain&ndash;currant, <i>Ribes alpinum</i>, which grows on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
bank of the half&ndash;lane, half&ndash;watercourse, running from
the lower side of the reservoir towards the river. It is
a large, green, leafy bush, with glossy foliage, and appears
to be the only one in the Prestwich neighbourhood.
How it got there is a botanical problem, yet only one
out of many of the same kind. Nature is for ever putting
some droll spectacle before our eyes, and playing pantomimes
for our amusement and curiosity, if we would but
care for them as they deserve. As Pott Shrigley is the
place above all others for bluebells, so is Mere Clough
the place above all others for its colleague the wood&ndash;anemone.
Tens of thousands of this lovely flower, the
fairest companion of the opening buds, grow in the open
spaces among the trees at the lower part, sheeting them
with the purest white, tinged here and there with a faint
blush, like sunbeams falling on snow. On a fine day at
the end of April or beginning of May, there is not a
more charming picture to be found. In the moister parts
of the clough, especially near the reservoir, may also now
be seen in perfection the deep yellow marsh&ndash;marigold.
Like the anemone, it is a common plant, but none the
less to be admired. The same as to that dainty little
flower, the wood&ndash;sorrel, which begins to open freely about
the time that the anemones depart. Easily discovered by
means of its curious leaves, which are formed of three
triangular pieces, placed on the summit of a little stalk,
and rise about three inches above the ground, no one can
fail to be charmed with its fairy form and the delicacy
of the lilac pencillings on the inner surface of the petals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
which are white as those of the anemone itself. Anemone,
translated, signifies &#8220;wind&ndash;flower,&#8221; a name intended to
denote fugacity of the petals, or fall at the first touch.
But such is not the fate of the anemone&ndash;petals of to&ndash;day.
The original application of the name would appear to
have been to the cistus. It was into this last that the
frail goddess transformed her love, her tears represented
in the disappearance in a moment.</p>

<p>Emerging from the clough, the difficulty is not which
way to get home again, but which pleasant way to give
the preference to. We may go past the dyeworks, and
through the park to Agecroft Bridge; or turn up the lane
that curls back towards Prestwich; or, best of all, make
our way under the magnificent viaduct of the East
Lancashire Railway, and then across the river to Clifton
Aqueduct. Arrived here, there is another ample choice;
either to ride home from the adjacent station &#40;Clifton
Junction&#41;; to descend to the Irwell bank, and walk
through the meadows bordering the river to Agecroft
Bridge; or to take the fields and canal bank, the latter
in some parts very pretty, and so to Pendleton, where
Mr. Greenwood will be glad to see us, and the feeling
probably be reciprocal. To invigorate ourselves, if
purposing to walk, it is prudent, and not difficult, to
procure tea at one of the cottages near the station. At
one in particular, standing back a little from the road,
upon the left, with&mdash;at the bottom of the garden&mdash;a
nice, cool, face&ndash;refreshing well, that we have seen give
challenge on fair cheeks to the morning dew upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
rose, there is a free, plentiful, whole&ndash;hearted hospitality,
that adds quite a charm to the associations already so
pleasant, of summer afternoon in the sweet stillness of
Mere Clough. The hostess is as large as her welcome;
the bread and butter is incomparable.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Every one who
has gone by train to Bolton or Bury, will remember this
beautiful valley, sometimes called the Agecroft, sometimes
after its river, the Irwell. On the left, as soon as
Pendleton is passed, the high grounds of Pendlebury
come into view, their brows covered with trees. On the
right, first we have broad, sweet lawns of meadow and
pasture, and in autumn yellow corn&ndash;fields; and, beyond
these, rising in terraced slopes, with deep bays and
rounded promontories, according as the hill recedes or
swells, the woods overlooking Agecroft Park, presently
succeeded by those of Prestwich. For fully two miles
the eye rests upon rich masses of leaf, interrupted only
by mounds of tender green, the crests of the Rainsall and
Agecroft hills, and towards the close, the picturesque
tower of Prestwich Church. The course of the river
may be traced by the winding line of continuous foliage,
but the water is too low down to be discerned until we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
catch sight of the white cottage at the foot of Mere
Clough, immediately after passing which, if upon the
Bury line, we continue along the viaduct and therefrom
get a full view, as well as of banks lined to the water&#8217;s
edge with vegetation. Here the scenery changes entirely,
though retained for a short distance on the Bolton line,
and we quit the Agecroft valley. Not one of the other
railway approaches to our town&mdash;ten minutes completing
the journey&mdash;bears any comparison with this for beauty;
indeed, it is quite a surprise to people entering Manchester
for the first time by way of Bolton or Bury, to
find so picturesque a country at the very edge.</p>

<p>The best way to the valley on foot is to go over Kersal
Moor, descending on the further side, and so onward,
past the print&ndash;works, to Agecroft Bridge, which we must
cross, and turn to the right. If more convenient, there
is a way by Pendleton and Charlestown, crossing the
Bolton railway, then along the path by the river&ndash;side.
But this, as to its earlier part, is a disagreeable means of
access, and very little is really gained. Going by Kersal,
on the other hand, we come at once into a green,
sequestered walk, which accompanying the river for
about a mile, then changes to the bank of the canal,
and will take us, if we please, to the aqueduct, and
thence round by the cottages to the station. The road
straight away from the bridge leads to Pendlebury, to
which village there is also a pleasant path across the
fields, after ascending the river&ndash;side some little distance.
Keeping to the Kersal side of the river there is a delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
walk through Agecroft Park, beneath the woods, to
the foot of the dells; another, by diverging a little
to the left when out of the park, through a farmyard, to
the river and viaduct; and if, instead of going through
the park, we turn up on the right among the cottages, it
is not difficult to penetrate the woods themselves, and to
find one or two paths over the hills, all tending to Prestwich
as a common point. So numerous and varied are
the paths which converge hitherwards and in the direction
of Clifton Aqueduct, that it is impossible to go
wrong. Were we to give a preference, it would be to
the walk first described, or that along the river&ndash;side,
commencing at Agecroft Bridge, and having the river
upon the right. The meadows abound with floral
treasures, the rosy bistort, the blue geranium, and the
fragrant ciceley, in their several seasons, and on the
banks, at the further part, near the canal, may be seen
the broad&ndash;leaved wood&ndash;stitchwort, <i>Stellaria memorum</i>,
and the yellow dead&ndash;nettle. Early in June is the
pleasantest time to go. The grass is then uncut, the
sycamores are hung with their honeyed bloom, the clover
glows like rubies, the white pagodas of the butter&ndash;bur,
now gone to seed, stand up like the banners of an army,
and we find &#8220;the <i>first</i> rose of summer, sweet blooming
alone,&#8221; amid thousands of juvenile green buds.</p>

<p>But the yellow dead&ndash;nettle is the most interesting; it
gives so useful a lesson in practical botany. The stem
is perfectly square; the leaves grow two together; the
large golden&ndash;coloured blossoms are set in verandahs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
round the stalk, each particular flower shaped like the
jaws of some terrible wild beast, wide&ndash;open and ready to
bite, while the stamens are invariably four in number&mdash;a
pair of long ones and a pair of short ones. The seeds,
also, are exactly four. Whenever these peculiarities
co&ndash;exist in a plant, we may be sure that there is nothing
deleterious about it. More than fifty different plants
formed on this plan grow wild in England, and considerably
over two thousand in foreign countries, and not
one of them is in the least degree noxious, either to
quadruped or to man. Many are aromatic, and used
with food, as thyme, sage, mint, basil, and penny&ndash;royal;
while others are useful for medicinal tea, as balm and
ground&ndash;ivy. Rosemary, lavender, and bergamot belong to
the same fragrant family. The great object of botanical
science is to determine such facts as these, <i>i.e.</i>, to make
out the relation between the form of a plant and its
properties;&mdash;can a science of such useful, practical aim
be justly deemed, as by some, mere &#8220;learned trifling?&#8221;
Surely not. No slight advantage has that man over his
fellows who, when he is walking through the meadows,
or when he emigrates to a distant land, can discriminate
between the poisonous plant and the wholesome, simply
by examining the leaves and flowers. We do not mean
to say that every individual plant in the world has its
exact quality unmistakably configured upon it. The
concurrence is between certain general properties and
certain great types or plans of organisation, taking note
of which latter we gain a good general idea of the former.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
The <i>particular</i> nature must be learned by special inquiry.
Though the yellow dead&ndash;nettle, for example, is
shown by its general structure to be devoid of anything
bad, it cannot be told whether it is fit to eat until tasted
and tried. To persons who have an idea of emigrating,
or whose children are likely to go abroad, botany is of
the very highest service, for in foreign countries men are
thrown upon their own resources, and to be compelled
by ignorance to look upon every leaf as a possible poison
is helplessness of the most wretched kind.</p>

<p>The railway up the Agecroft valley is interesting as the
first that was constructed after the Liverpool and Manchester,
and perhaps the &#8220;Grand Junction.&#8221; People used
to go to the Prestwich hills to watch the trains scudding
along. The scenery here is certainly not spoiled by it.
For our own part, we consider that scenery is scarcely
ever spoiled by the presence of railways, and would
contend rather that they are a capital addition; for
those spectacles are always most salutary to the mind,
and therefore most truly pleasing, where along with
rural beauties are combined the grand circumstances of
human life and human enterprise. Railways count with
bridges, ships, gardens, the castles and abbeys of the
past, and the mansions of the present. Nature is
beautiful, even in its most retired and lonely solitudes,
just in the proportion that we connect with it, though
unconsciously, the interests, the feelings, the aspirations
of humanity; the more of what is noble and comely in
human life we are able to assimilate with the outer world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the more does that world minister to our happiness and
our intelligence. In the case of the railways, we are
recipients of an immense amount of good. There is
not only the interest of what is witnessed on the instant,
but the pleasant flow of remembrance of the various
localities they lead to. As, looking at the sea, we are
led in thought all round the world, so, looking at the
winged train and its pearly clouds, we visit over again
a thousand delicious spots, photographed on the mind,
and endeared by association. Here, for instance, in the
valley of the Irwell, we go on to the lakes of Cumberland,
and its ancient and purple mountains, and anon
to the flowered and roofless aisles of sacred Furness.
Should these be places yet unknown, there are nearer
ones where we <i>have</i> been,&mdash;Rivington, Summerseat,
Hoghton Tower, with its precipitous beechen&ndash;wood and
lovely walk by the river underneath; or Southshore,
where grow the blue eryngo and the grass of Parnassus,
and where, on calm September evenings, the round, red
setting sun pours a stream of crimson light across the
sea, that reaches to the last ripple of the retiring water,
like a path of velvet unrolled for the feet of a queen;
or, if the wind blow high and fresh, the grand old deep&ndash;voiced
waves, with their gray locks hanging dishevelled
over their broad bosoms, roll gloriously over the rattling
pebbles, change for a moment into arcades as white as
snow, then dissolve into a wilderness of foam. Thus to
make the common things of life so many centres of
thought, from which we can travel away to whole worlds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of pleasant remembrance, lying calm perhaps in the
golden light of lang syne, is one of the profoundest
secrets of happiness, and one of the most useful habits
we can cultivate. Every one may acquire the art, and
it strengthens every day and year that we live. Happiness
is not a wonderful diamond, to be sought afar off,
but, rightly understood, a thing to be reaped every day
out of the ordinary facts of life, even out of the sight
of a railway train steaming across the fields.</p>

<p>The plants of the woods and hills bordering the Agecroft
valley are mostly the same that are found in Mere
Clough. In addition to those above enumerated, may
be mentioned the pretty round&ndash;leaved marsh&ndash;violet, the
whortleberry, and the wild cherry, one of the gayest
ornaments of the month of May. The whortleberry
seldom ripens its fruit at Prestwich, or anywhere so near
the town: it seems to require the bracing air of the
moors and mountains. It is one of the shrubs which
rival the trees in brilliancy of tint, assumed as in the sky,
when the hour of departure is at hand. Along with the
Canadian medlar, the bramble, and some kinds of azalea,
the leaves change not infrequently to vivid crimson.
People are apt to call these changes the &#8220;fading&#8221; of
the leaf; it would be better to say the <i>painting</i>.
Primroses are exceedingly scarce, both on the Agecroft
hills and in the Irwell valley, and their place is unoccupied
by any other vernal flower as fair and popular.
The wild pansy is there, on the higher and drier ground,
and often with remarkably large and handsome flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
but it makes no show; and though there are daffodils in
a few places, they are not prominent to view. A field
at the head of Prestwich Dells is for a little time plentifully
strewed with their lively yellow. When September
comes the want of the primrose is almost compensated
by the cheerful autumn crocus, which lifts its purple
abundantly among the grass, in the low meadows on
the further side of Kersal Moor, near the rivulet; also
in the fields below Prestwich Church, the same that in
spring are dressed with the daffodil, and again in those
between the asylum and the dells. The autumnal
crocus, like the colchicum, is curious in seeming to produce
its seeds before the flowers, the former being ripe
in May and June, whereas the latter do not open till
three months after. When the great Swedish botanist,
Linn&aelig;us, was engaged in promulgating the great doctrine
of the sexuality of plants, now about a century and
a half ago, the circumstance in question was pointed to
as upsetting it. But the young seed&ndash;pod lies low down
in the bosom of the leaves, where it is fertilised, as in
all other flowers, by the pollen from the stamens, and
there it abides during the winter, elevating itself above
the ground with the warmth of the ensuing summer,
when it ripens and scatters its contents. The true time
of the vital energy of the autumn crocus is thus, not
from May to September, but from September until May.
The history has always seemed to us a memorable instance
of the quiet dignity with which truth and genuine
science pursue their way, triumphing and silencing all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the little cavillers in the end, however plausible they may
make their case at starting.</p>

<p>Before quitting this beautiful valley it will be salutary
to pause for a moment upon its geological history, since,
with the single exception of that part of the Mersey
valley which lies between Didsbury and Cheadle, it is
the newest part of our neighbourhood. The date, that
is to say, is the nearest preceding that of the first occupation
of the British Islands by mankind. The great
ridges of Kinder Scout, Glossop, and Greenfield are
immensely more ancient than any of the exposed or
superficial parts of the country threaded by the Mersey
at Cheadle, and by the Irwell below Prestwich. With
the remainder of the chain of hills to which the Greenfield
summits belong, those great ridges form the eastern
margin of an enormous and very irregular stone basin,
tilted up in such a way that the opposite or western edge
is concealed far below the surface of the ground, nobody
can tell exactly where, but in the direction of the Irish
Sea, perhaps under it, far away beyond Southport and the
sandhills. It is within or upon the inner surface of this
great basin that all the other South Lancashire rocks and
strata have their seat. In different portions of its huge
lap are deposited the Coal strata &#40;themselves often much
elevated above the level on which the deposit took place,
and this at various periods&#41;; then, in ascending order,
there are deposits called &#8220;Permian&#8221;;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> above these, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
turn, come the Triassic rocks; and over all &#40;except on
the higher hill&ndash;ranges&#41; there is sand or clay, or gravel,
both stratified and unstratified. This last, in the aggregate,
is technically termed &#8220;Drift.&#8221; The whole of this
great surface was unquestionably once covered by salt
water. At the latest period of that marvellous marine
dominion, blocks of ice containing boulders floated in it;
and wherever great heaps of sand now occur, we have
the remains of ancient beaches or sand&ndash;banks, many of
which were cut through by the water, while others are
charged with pebbles that had been rounded by rolling
over and over upon some primeval shore, rattling while
on their journeys, just as at Walney Island we may hear
the pebbles of to&ndash;day. The lofty eastern edges of this
great stone basin are, as would be anticipated, quite free
from deposits of drift. But everywhere else, westwards,
drift covers up all the underlying rock, the latter showing
itself only where rivers in cutting their channels have
slowly worn it away.</p>

<p>The Agecroft valley participates with all the rest of the
district in the possession of drift. Here, however, is well
shown, in addition, how the first settlings of gravel and
sand often themselves became covered at a later period
with yet another new deposit&mdash;material brought down
and diffused by shallow and tranquil streams, then of
considerable breadth, but which in course of time shrank
into relatively narrow ones, and continue as such to the
present moment. That the lower Irwell, as we have it in
the Agecroft valley, was once a broad flood of this description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
is declared by the &#8220;river&ndash;terraces&#8221; discoverable at
intervals all the way up, and which correspond with those
that betoken the ancient presence of the waters of the
Mersey at a much greater elevation than at present.
Abney Hall is built upon one of these river&ndash;terraces.
Cheadle village stands upon a yet higher and older one.</p>

<p>Peculiarly associated with the valley of the Irwell, and
the adjacent cloughs and woods of Stand and Prestwich,
is the memory of John Horsefield, one of the most celebrated
of the old Lancashire operative botanists. It was
Horsefield who first showed us the way through Mere
Clough, and pointed out the spots occupied by its rare
plants. For thirty&ndash;two years he was president and chief
stay of the Prestwich Botanical Society, and from 1830,
up to the time of his death, president also of the united
societies of the whole district. He earned his livelihood
as a hand&ndash;loom weaver, following that occupation in a
cottage at Besses&ndash;o&#8217;&ndash;th&#8217;&ndash;Barn. Though the small wages
his employment yielded him, and the trifling amount of
leisure it permitted him to enjoy, naturally hindered
pursuit of his darling science so fully as he desired, it is
marvellous to see how much he accomplished. In the
<i>Manchester Guardian</i> of March 2nd, 1850, in the course
of a long and very interesting autobiography, he gives
some slight idea of his labours. &#8220;Since I first held office
as president,&#8221; he tells us, &#8220;I have attended upwards of
four hundred of these general meetings; thousands of
specimens have passed through my hands, and all my
reward or fee is the privilege of being scot&ndash;free.&#8221; With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
that autobiography easily accessible, it is unnecessary to
do more here than to point to it, and to a continuation
of the narrative in the papers of the April following,
which include several pieces of original poetry. Perhaps
nothing has ever appeared which shows more strikingly
how an indomitable will and ardent thirst for knowledge,
and a deep and faithful love of nature, will triumph over
the obstacles of poor means and humble station in life,
and lift a man into the high places of true science, and
give him at once the power of usefulness to his fellow&ndash;creatures,
and of realising the true rewards of existence.
Horsefield was a member of the Banksian Society, but
rarely came to the meetings of the Mechanics&#8217; Institution
class, reserving himself for those country musters where
his knowledge and good nature had the full wide scope
which they at once merited and deserved. In person he
was thin and spare, presenting a great contrast to the tall
and patriarchal figure of Crozier, partaking, however, so
far as we had opportunities of judging, of all his amiable,
unsophisticated qualities.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A CHAPTER may here be legitimately devoted
to the men in whose wake Horsefield and
Crozier followed and to their own principal
companions. The history of these men is
peculiar. It is not simply that of individuals,
but inseparably identified with that
of the botanical societies of South East Lancashire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the neighbourhood, without question the most remarkable
in England. Every man of course has had his
own private and personal history, but the energies and
activities of each have been so closely intermingled with
those of his companions that the history is essentially
like that of a tree or a corporate body,&mdash;not so much of
many things as of an organic whole. Many persons
have never so much as heard of these societies, though
assembling almost at their very doors. While the learned
and wealthy have been holding brilliant <i>soir&eacute;es</i> and
<i>conversazioni</i> in lecture halls and royal institutions, meetings
have been going on among the weavers and other
craftsmen, quietly and unostentatiously, with aims exactly
similar, and success not inferior, and probably with tenfold
more enjoyment to the bulk of those attending
them, because of its simplicity and earnestness. Should
the history of science in Lancashire ever come to be
written at length, it would be wanting in one of its most
interesting and important chapters were the proceedings
of these societies to be omitted, whether the members
who composed them were thought worthy of mention or
not. The sketch we propose to give must necessarily
be brief, but it will serve to indicate what a large amount
of real, practical scientific knowledge exists among the
workpeople of our district, and how superior these men
are to the mere herb&ndash;gatherers or &#8220;yarb&ndash;doctors&#8221; with
whom they have often been confounded, and who, though
useful in their way, constitute an entirely different class.</p>

<p>The study of botany by the operatives about Manchester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
at least in a precise and methodical manner,
appears to date from the establishment of the Linn&aelig;an
system, which was one hundred years ago. Doubtless
the neighbourhood was already remarkable for its <i>love</i> of
plants, since men do not jump at things like the Linn&aelig;an
system unless they have taste for them beforehand; but
prior to the time of Linn&aelig;us, the difficulties attendant on
botany as a science were too great for it to be anywhere
a popular pastime. It was in Lancashire, without
question, in life and power, though not in determined
fact. There is reason to believe that botany, in some
sort, was cultivated in Lancashire as far back as the
time of Ray, who described, in his &#8220;Synopsis,&#8221; nearly
four&ndash;fifths of the British plants, and frequently refers to
north&ndash;country botanists in connection with the localities
of rare species. They were probably the originals of those
keen observers and ardent cultivators whose succession
has never yet intermitted. Ray&#8217;s work made its first
appearance in 1670. What is meant by the &#8220;Linn&aelig;an
System&#8221; must be learnt from books devoted to its elucidation.
It will suffice to say of it here that it established
a method of classifying plants which gave it vantage, not
only for successfully clearing the ground of difficulties
which were fast becoming insuperable to smaller schemes
and threatening the very existence of botany, but
rendered everything intelligible and delightful. No
really practical system had been devised previously to
the time of Linn&aelig;us, and though his classes and orders
are now superseded by the grander and profounder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
&#8220;Natural System,&#8221; which it was Linn&aelig;us&#8217; own desire to
arrive at&mdash;acknowledging his sexual or &#8220;Artificial System&#8221;
to be but temporary and provisional,&mdash;when it appeared
it may fairly be said to have made that live which before
was dead or dying, and to have been the true inauguration
of the science of botany.</p>

<p>The period referred to was, in round numbers then,
fully one hundred years ago. No records are extant as
to what was actually done here at that time, but the
general fact that botany was ardently engaged in is well
established. Old Crowther, who was born in 1768, was
accustomed, when only nine years of age, to attend the
meetings of a botanical society at Eccles, numbering, on
the average, forty members,&mdash;the first society, in all likelihood,
that was formed by the young Linn&aelig;ans, and the
same, it may be concluded, as that which in 1790, or
thereabouts, had spread to Ashton, Oldham, Middleton,
and many other places, holding fixed monthly meetings
at the several towns and villages in rotation, and with
which the proper &#8220;historical era&#8221; of botany in Manchester
may be said to commence. The business of the
meetings was to compare the floras of the several neighbourhoods,
and to exchange plants and information in
general on subjects connected with botanical science.
A library of practical service was formed at a very early
period. The members subscribed, and bought among
other books the &#8220;Systema Natur&aelig;,&#8221; and &#8220;Species Plantarum,&#8221;
of Linn&aelig;us; Withering&#8217;s &#8220;British Plants,&#8221; and
Lee&#8217;s &#8220;Introduction to Botany,&#8221; exchanging the volumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
with one another on the days of meeting, and for several
years everything went on pleasantly and usefully. With
the close of the century, however, owing to infractions of
the rules, the meetings were discontinued, and the society
was abruptly dissolved.</p>

<p>But death is everywhere the spring and herald of life.
Though for a time there was no regular society, meetings
continued to be held in a more private way, and, as
generally happens after an interregnum, new and better
principles of management were introduced, resulting in
the formation of those numerous and excellent local
societies which started botany afresh, and several of the
best of which are still at work. The late venerable John
Mellor, of Royton, near Oldham, is generally considered
to have laid the foundation of the new school. Associated
with him were the celebrated John Dewhurst, first president
of the collective meetings, and George Caley, well
known to the scientific as the botanist who accompanied
Sir Joseph Banks to the South Seas. The society which
lays claim to primogeniture is that at Middleton, or, at
all events the Middleton <i>District</i> Society. Its former
president, the late Mr. John Turner, possessed a letter
written from Australia in 1800, in which Caley warmly
acknowledges his obligations to the members, as having
first given him a love for plants. The Mottram Society
is also of long date, having celebrated forty&ndash;four anniversaries.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
To make this matter of relative age more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
intelligible, it may be observed that the local societies
group themselves into &#8220;districts,&#8221; and that the name of a
local society is sometimes the same as that of a district
society. For instance, the Ashton&ndash;under&ndash;Lyne district
takes in Ashton, Stalybridge, Mottram, Glossop, Tintwistle,
&amp;c., and has both monthly meetings and &#8220;bye&ndash;meetings;&#8221;
the Rochdale district comprises Rochdale,
Middleton, Milnrow, Todmorden, Harpurhey, &amp;c.; the
Bredbury district includes Stockport, Disley, Hatherlow,
&amp;c.; and so with the others. The Prestwich local
society, the nearest, and in many respects the most
interesting to Manchester, has been in existence thirty&ndash;eight
years, having been established September 11th,
1820. &#40;Now, of course, extended to sixty&ndash;two.&#41;</p>

<p>Gradually, after this fresh start, the whole of the
country lying north&ndash;west, north, and north&ndash;east of Manchester
became animated with the love of botany; as far
even as from Disley and Todmorden came the echo of
the new music; and under the successive presidentships
&#40;after John Dewhurst&#8217;s&#41; of Edward Hobson, the great
bryologist, then of John Horsefield, and subsequently of
James Percival, a man of extraordinary information, both
in accuracy and amount, the meetings have gone on
uninterruptedly and happily, and never were they more
satisfactory than at the present moment. The list for
1858, printed along with the rules, announces twenty&ndash;six
of the grand general gatherings, or a meeting every
fortnight, and fifteen different places of assembly. The
most successful meetings have been at Prestwich,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Ashton&ndash;under&ndash;Lyne, Blackley, Bury, Rochdale, Middleton,
Oldham, Whitefield, Eccles, Ringley, Radcliffe, and
Harpurhey; and the best attended, the last year or two,
those held at Prestwich, Whitefield, and Bury. The
meetings, as at the beginning, are held upon the Sunday
afternoon, at some respectable tavern, such being the only
place where working men can assemble inexpensively;
and though this may seem to some persons detrimental to
good order and sobriety, no religious service was ever
more decorously conducted. Working men can assemble
at a tavern, and not abuse it, quite as well as gentlemen;
in either case, all depends on the ideas they carry in with
them. It is the peculiar characteristic of intelligent
delight in the objects of nature, that, with very rare
exceptions, it brings with it a moral and harmonising
influence on the heart, so that men who gather together
as our Lancashire botanists do, albeit in a public&ndash;house
and on a Sunday, are the most likely of all in their
station of life, to conduct themselves in a manner becoming
intelligent beings. When the churchwardens or
other peace&ndash;officers think proper to walk in, as sometimes
happens, they always express themselves satisfied. Twice
only, during upwards of seventy years, have the meetings
been interfered with by the authorities, and in neither
case has it been from disapproval of them, or because of
misconduct on the part of the members. The second
occasion, which alone had notoriety, fell in November,
1850, when the men had assembled, as often before, at
the &#8220;Ostrich,&#8221; in Rooden Lane. The landlord of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
house had made himself obnoxious to the law, but in
such a way, whatever it was, that he could only be
reached by the unfortunate botanists being made the
scape&ndash;goat.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The ale is not <i>forgotten</i>, nor would it be
wisely forgotten if it were. Water is good, but so, in
their season, are good wine and good ale. &#8220;My specimens,&#8221;
once said old Crowther, in his quaint, quiet way,
when nearly eighty years had silvered his hair, his eyes
twinkling as he spoke, &#8220;my specimens always look best
through a glass!&#8221; Capital botanical libraries are possessed
by the societies at Todmorden, Ashton, Oldham,
Miles Platting, Prestwich, and Boothstown. Several of
the societies also possess herbariums. The Prestwich
collection, which fills nearly one hundred and sixty
volumes, contains a beautiful series of specimens prepared
by the celebrated Mr. Shepherd, once curator of the
Liverpool Botanic Garden. Many of the members
further amuse themselves by cultivating curious plants,
the roots of which have been chiefly obtained by making
excursions, for the special purpose, into North Wales, the
Lake district, and the more romantic parts of Derbyshire
and Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Once a year, on a Sunday fixed as near the height of
the flower season as possible, there is an extra grand
meeting, when deputations from all the societies in the
neighbourhood make a point of attending. That of 1858
was held on the 11th of August at the &#8220;Golden Lion,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Harpurhey, twenty or thirty different societies being
represented. The proceedings were reported by the
writer of these pages in the <i>Manchester Weekly Times</i>
of the ensuing Saturday, the account, after some preliminary
observations, continuing as follows:&mdash;&#8220;The
botanists began to assemble soon after two o&#8217;clock, and
at three, when the proceedings commenced, there were
present no fewer than two hundred and twelve, all, with
the exception of four or five, working men, and not more
than the odd dozen or so unconnected with one or other
of the societies. It is a striking and most pleasing fact,
for the consideration of intelligent people, that there
should be in and about Manchester a body of naturalists
able to send two hundred zealous and well&ndash;informed
representatives to an annual meeting where the object of
assembly was purely social. Whatever else the cotton
manufacturing districts may be in the eyes of people at
a distance, here, at least, is a characteristic that cannot
be disputed, and such as no other system or trade in
the country has tended either to develope or encourage.
The meeting took place on the large bowling&ndash;green
behind the inn. At the lower extremity was placed a
table, some twenty yards long, and covered throughout
its whole length with specimens of flowers, mostly curious
and uncommon, and about half of which were British,
with the addition of a few stove and greenhouse plants,
contributed by gentlemen&#8217;s gardeners. After a little time
spent in conversation, the president, James Percival, was
called to the chair, from which he gave the names of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
about one hundred and fifty of the most remarkable
exhibits, first the Latin, and then the English, often with
some little remark upon their nature or place of growth.
The accuracy of his naming was not more remarkable
than the correctness of the pronunciation, showing how
mistaken is the popular notion that the Latin or scientific
names of plants are harder to learn than the English
ones. Percival having concluded, his place was taken
by John Nowell, of Todmorden, who similarly named a
quantity of mosses, and when these were finished a box
of beautiful ferns was opened by Mr. Tom Stansfield, of
the same town, and the contents disposed of in the same
manner. If any difference of opinion arose as to the
correctness of a name, the specimen was handed about
for criticism, but it rarely happened that either of the
three spokesmen had made even so much as a slip of
the tongue. The plants having all been named and distributed,
some routine business was transacted, and the
meeting, as to its formal part, broke up, having lasted
very nearly three hours. The remainder of the evening was
spent, like the commencement, in friendly chat. This was
in many respects quite as interesting as the regular business,
the opportunity being afforded for intimate converse
with one after another of two hundred as thoroughly
good&ndash;hearted and intelligent men as ever met together,
full of anecdote of themselves and their companions,
never vainly putting forth their knowledge without call
for it, but never allowing the slightest error to pass
unchallenged. No discussions of learned doctors were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
ever more vigorous and entertaining than those of our
botanists on the green of the &#8220;Golden Lion.&#8221; Among the
chief botanists present, in addition to those already mentioned,
were George Hulme, Prestwich; Edwin Clough
and Henry Newton, Ashton&ndash;under&ndash;Lyne; Tom Bleackley,
Whitefield; John Shaw, Eccles; Isaac Ollerenshaw,
Glossop; John Darbyshire, Newton; William Bentley,
Royton; James Devonport, Droylsden; John Turner,
Middleton; Richard Buxton, John Crowe, and John
Warburton, Manchester; William and James Horsefield,
sons of John; Mr. Isaac Williamson, of Stockport; and
Mr. Lund, president of the Rochdale Society. Mr.
Edwin Waugh, Mr. Henry Robson, and several other
visitors from Manchester also attended.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not the least pleasing feature of the meeting in
question consisted in the number of men in advanced
years who were enjoying its incidents,&mdash;fine specimens
of youth carried along into mature life,&mdash;that most
admirable and noble condition of human nature, and
looking as if they were never going to be old. They
showed how true it is that spirit is youth, and that the
want of spirit is age,&mdash;that life measures not by birthdays,
but by capacity for noble enjoyments, and that he who
would be a Man, must never forget to be a Boy. It
avails nothing for a man to live sixty or seventy years,
unless he carry along with him the freshness and cheerfulness
of his youth, and nothing so powerfully contributes
to keeping the heart green, as simple and true love of
country pleasures and country productions. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
true old age, and that which we should set ourselves to
attain. Our first duty is to live as long as we can; and
our chief wisdom, after the fear of God, is to cultivate
those tastes which make youth of spirit last till birthdays
come no more. The actual longevity both of naturalists
in general, and of many of the Lancashire men in particular,
is a fact of no mean significance. Crowther was
seventy&ndash;nine when he died; John Mellor, eighty&ndash;two;
Elias Hall, the geologist, eighty&ndash;nine. Timothy Harrop,
of Middleton, with whose work, as a bird and animal
stuffer, the British Association were so well pleased when
they visited Manchester in 1842; and Josiah Nuttall, of
Heywood, were also very old men. Whether this
longevity is to be attributed to the quiet and temperate
habits which the study of natural history almost invariably
induces, or to the continual out&ndash;door exercise inseparable
from genuine pursuit of it; or to the quickening of the
intelligence and affections, and the invigoration of the
bodily health, which, by a beautiful law of nature, always
so gratefully ensues;&mdash;there is evidently a something
about natural history&mdash;other circumstances being equal&mdash;wonderfully
promotive of length of days. Men never
step into the presence of nature with affection and
reverence, but they come back blessed and strengthened
with a reward.</p>

<p>Let us now look a little more closely at the individuals.
The lives of some of them are before the world,&mdash;told in
those interesting, though &#8220;short and simple annals,&#8221;
which have appeared in the local press from time to time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
such as the autobiography of John Horsefield, who died
March 6th, 1854, and the obituary notice of Crowther,
which filled a column and a half of the <i>Manchester
Guardian</i>, of January 13th, 1847, a week after his
decease. Crowther was a Banksian, and one of the
most simple&ndash;hearted men that ever lived; willing to
travel any distance, and undergo any amount of fatigue,
so that he secured his flower. As one of his old companions
remarked to me some years ago, &#8220;he was not
<i>learned</i>, but he was very <i>loving</i>.&#8221; It is worthy also of
record that Crowther never touched his wages for purposes
of botanical pleasure, but took home every penny,
and trusted to fortunate accidents for the means of
supplying his scientific wants. Of the indefatigable and
acute George Caley, who was born at Craven in 1770,
and died May 23rd, 1829, there is a pleasing memoir in
the &#8220;Magazine of Natural History,&#8221; vol. ii., p. 310; and
vol. iii., p. 226. A similar memoir of Edward Hobson,
who died September 7th, 1830, may be seen in the
&#8220;Transactions of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical
Society,&#8221; vol. vi., 1842. Buxton&#8217;s is prefixed to
the &#8220;Guide,&#8221; and several other memoirs have since been
given by Mr. Cash in his delightful little book, &#8220;When
there&#8217;s a Will there&#8217;s a Way.&#8221; These appear to be the
whole of the memoirs of any length that have been
printed, though there have frequently been short notices
when death has carried off another of the band. It
would be well were they reprinted in a collective form.
Unmarked though they are by stirring incidents, the lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of these men are such as no person of feeling and intelligence,
and sympathy with pure, hearty, honest endeavour
after knowledge and self&ndash;improvement, can peruse without
emotion. Science owes more to them than has ever
been confessed, and it is anything but honourable to
public taste and public morals, that while the lives of
murderers and rascals of all descriptions are read with
avidity, and the minutest incidents of their abominable
careers demanded and fed upon, the lives of the modest,
unassuming votaries of science, both the dead and those
who are yet with us, are never so much as inquired for.
They have their reward. If it be not in the notoriety of
a great criminal, it is in the perennial enjoyment of the
highest faculties of our nature, such as are brought out
only by loving conversance with the works of God.</p>

<p>Scarcely anything is recorded of the earlier Lancashire
botanists. Of John Dewhurst, mentioned as the first
president of the restored botanical society at the beginning
of the present century, little more is known than that
he was a fustian&ndash;cutter by trade, and lived at Red Bank.
John Shaw, now of Eccles &#40;since deceased&#41;, remembers
seeing him in his &#8220;pride of place&#8221; at the &#8220;Lord Nelson,&#8221;
at Ringley, where the annual meeting was at that time
accustomed to be held, the first Sunday in May, Mr. S.
being then a child, and this the first botanical meeting he
was present at. Dewhurst died in Salford, about 1820, at
the age of about seventy. He was of a good and well&ndash;to&ndash;do
family, but in the position of &#8220;poor relation.&#8221; A
kind friend of the Lancashire botanists in those days,&mdash;Mr. Mitchell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of Bradford Hall,&mdash;gave Dewhurst and
Hobson a piece of ground adjoining his house for a
botanic garden. In this they were accustomed to
deposit the roots of plants procured in the course of
their rambles, going up every Monday morning for the
purpose. It happened at that time that there were
great operatives&#8217; political meetings. One day, in 1812,
it came to Mr. Mitchell&#8217;s ears that the two botanists
were engaged to attend one of them, and at the same
moment he had private information that the magistrates
intended to disperse it, and send the leaders to prison,&mdash;Hobson
being one of the marked, and certain to be
apprehended. Luckily for all parties, the meeting was
appointed for the very day when the two botanists were
accustomed to visit their garden. Up they went as
usual, early in the morning, from which time till late
in the afternoon their host contrived, probably without
much difficulty, to keep them engaged with liquid
refreshment, and thus saved Hobson at all events from
imprisonment. As the two men journeyed homewards,
they met the soldiers and their captives on the way to
gaol. One of Dewhurst&#8217;s intimate associates was old
William Evans, of Tyldesley, now long deceased, a
friend from boyhood of Dr. Hull, Dr. Tomlinson, and
Dr. Withering, and companion also of George Caley.
&#8220;He was always after botany,&#8221; says a letter respecting
him, &#8220;and travelled many thousands of miles in quest
of plants.&#8221; That excellent botanist and worthy old
man, Joseph Evans, of Boothstown, to whom we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
had occasion to express our acknowledgments in the
&#8220;Manchester Flora,&#8221; is son of the renowned William.
Born in 1803, the lad, when only ten years of age, used
to be taken to the meetings, walking, of course, every
inch of the way, both there and back. He was also his
father&#8217;s constant companion in the fields. Ah, how
much is imbibed under such kindly teaching, and how
much more than we actually learn is excited and
animated! It is not so much what a man, even one&#8217;s
own father, tells us, tutor&ndash;fashion, that does the good
for one&#8217;s entire life&ndash;time, as what he <i>inspires</i> us with.
The man, or the woman either, upon whom we look
back as having supplied the aurora of our mental day,
when we think it out carefully, is he or she who taught us
not so much how to write and cast accounts, as how to
see and to feel&mdash;to see the wild&ndash;flowers, and the snow&ndash;crystals,
and the darting dragon&ndash;flies in their beautiful
blue corselets,&mdash;to listen to the hum of the busy bees
and the songs of the birds, and to feel that &#8220;he prayeth
best who loveth best all things both great and small.&#8221;
Evans was taught, when no more than ten years old,
how to contemplate the immortal beauty of nature. Like
his father before him, he had very little book&ndash;learning,
but he fed abundantly on the best and truest source of
all great and worthy ideas. A vigorous frame and an
admirable constitution enabled him to undertake journeys
on foot that to many would be positively affrighting.
He knew the contents of every wood and pond within
twenty miles of his home, the results of his long rambles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
plainly declared in the trim little garden adjoining his
cottage. The number of plants we once counted in
it, all curious, exceeded three hundred. Evans died
June 23rd, 1874, and was followed to his grave in
Worsley churchyard by more than a thousand people,
including a hundred and seventy young children. For of
the little folk, especially girls, he was always immensely
fond;&mdash;they went to the churchyard more of their own
accord than because led. His sympathy with them was
the sweetest of all sympathies&mdash;the sympathy of tenderness
and simplicity; no wonder that many of them
carried little chaplets of midsummer field flowers. We
often hear of magnificent funerals&mdash;chariots and plumes;
they may not, after all, be such as we should so well
care to be the pattern of our own. The cottage itself
wherein he resided was clean and bright as a sea&ndash;shell
just washed by the waves. If the love of the clear
purity of wild&ndash;flowers kept alive in old Evans the love
of one thing more than another, it would seem to have
been that of a home absolutely spotless, still maintained,
we believe, by one who always reminds us of a rose in
the snow. In figure Joseph Evans was tall and thin, a
lofty forehead conferring a dignity upon his appearance
which invariably attracted strangers. Never was this
more observable than at a natural history meeting once
at the Manchester Athen&aelig;um.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>No botanist contemporary with the elder Evans attained
greater celebrity than John Martin, of Tyldesley. He
was especially well&ndash;informed respecting Carices, and
first drew the attention of the botanists of Manchester
to the richness of the neighbourhood, supplying, in
regard to them, names and localities they knew not of,
as well as many facts respecting the botany of Tyldesley
in particular, with which he has never been properly
accredited. This eminent veteran was among us till so
late as August 13th, 1855.</p>

<p>The mantle of these old men has fallen well. Very
few of the botanists mentioned above are still alive&mdash;I
am glad to be able to add to the short list the name of
Richard Hampson, of Tyldesley; but they have plenty
of successors, and never more energetically than at the
present moment was natural history pursued as a pastime
in South East Lancashire.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of the original race are fast disappearing,
a circumstance plainly attributable to the facilities of
travel given by the railway system, to the multiplication
of books, and to the more general diffusion of knowledge.
At the period when the celebrity of the old
Lancashire botanists was established, say during the first
quarter of the present century, they lived in comparative
isolation. Now the isolation alike of abode and opportunities
has been cancelled, and as a consequence the
class of men who as individuals, somewhat conspicuous
in their way, gave it colour, have slowly disappeared.
The ancient spirit, nevertheless, is as keen as ever, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the love of botany in particular is quite as honourably
and intelligently represented as at any preceding time.
If we can no longer single out men very particularly
remarkable, it is because the estates of the patriarchs
have been divided, as it were, among whole troops of
worthy descendants.</p>

the railway entrance to east and central
Lancashire, since at this point, while the
original line runs on to Bolton, there is
divergence to Bury, whence, in turn, we
get to Accrington. After Molyneux Brow,
the first station is Ringley Road; then comes Radcliffe,
the village of the &#8220;red cliffs,&#8221; renowned in legend and

referred to, though bold and conspicuous, have none of
the picturesque beauty pertaining to Prestwich. Nor,
indeed, is the latter renewed until, after passing Bury, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
get to Summerseat, distant from Manchester thirteen
miles. The river, soon lost sight of after passing Molyneux,
here comes into view again, winding among trees,
and with steep declivities right and left. The eastern
side of the valley is abundantly wooded, and although
broken by little ravines, offers a delightful walk of about
two miles to the village of Ramsbottom. To begin
it, cross the little aqueduct over the gorge, then keep
straight on beneath the shadow of the wood. Beside
this pleasant path wild raspberries grow in plenty, and
ferns, and on the sunward edges of the steep brows above
the stream, not yet much sullied by &#8220;works,&#8221; in September
it is sweet to sit down to rest and talk, noting as we
chat the lilac blossoms of the heather. It does not, as
in the wilderness, monopolise the ground, but springs
delicately from the turf, here a little and there a little, in
quantity just enough to remind us that it is one of the
friendly plants, those of the same spirit as the anemone
and the celandine, which never care to live alone, but
&#8220;love their own kind and to dwell among their kindred.&#8221;
For the curious in other matters, up above again, on the
highest point, there is the celebrated tower which commemorates
the &#8220;Cheeryble Brothers,&#8221; William and Daniel
Grant. Looking across the river, the opposite bank is
remarkably different, the slopes being almost treeless.
Gradually swelling, at last they expand into a vast tract
of moorland called Holcombe Hill, well chosen for the
erection of the far&ndash;seen landmark called the Peel
monument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Ramsbottom is succeeded by Stubbins, and after this
we get to Newchurch, the best place to ascend from
when bound for the other great moorland called Fo&#8217;edge,
where the parsley&ndash;fern grows, and the alpine club&ndash;moss,
and many another plant that disdains the lowlands, and
from which, if we please, we may pursue a glorious walk
to Rochdale, making acquaintance as we go with the
bright and wilful Spodden. Running down Healey Dene,
a narrow and romantic valley, the bordering cliffs seem
to have been torn asunder at various times by the
impetuosity of the rushing torrent. So picturesque is the
dingle called specially the Thrutch,&mdash;the river here, in
Lancashire phrase, thrutching its way past all impediment,&mdash;that
one seems to be far away beyond the Tweed.
From the elevated ground above there is once again a
wonderful prospect, covering Lyme, Cloud&ndash;end, the
Derbyshire hills, Frodsham, and the mountains of North
Wales,&mdash;a prospect enjoyed, moreover, like that one
from Jackson Edge, at an incredibly slight expenditure
of climbing power. This fine neighbourhood may of
course be reached direct from Rochdale, going by the
Todmorden line; but geographically it belongs to Rossendale,
in which both the Spodden and the Roch have
their simple beginnings, wherein also, near the foot of
Derpley Hill, we find the cradle of the Irwell. &#8220;Rossendale
Forest,&#8221; so called, the name having a sense similar
to that of Delamere Forest <a href="#Page_41">&#40;p. 41&#41;</a> is approached by way
of Bacup. Lying upon the northern edge of the line,
the forest presents, with almost the whole of the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
that stretches away to Cliviger, an endless variety of
beautiful change in mountain scenery. Up here are
found the grand summits called Hades Hill and Thieveley
Pike, the view from the top of the last&ndash;named
comprehending not only the southward country, but to
the north, almost the whole of Craven, with Ingleborough
and the wilds of Trawden Forest. The nearer portions
of the Lake District mountains, those which rise above
Cartmel, and that bathe their ancient feet in Coniston
are also distinguishable; and on sunny evenings, when
the atmosphere is clear, and if the tide be in, the estuary
of the Ribble. Cliviger is remarkable not alone for the
rocks and precipices the name denotes, but for the
number of beautiful curves, green with much grass, which
are interwoven with them, these latter constantly adding
the very sweet unusual feature in scenery, of vast
hemispherical green bowls, the whole country at the
same time, if we push far enough into the solitude, so
tranquil.</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p><span class="add8em">O&#8217;er stiller place</span><br />
No singing skylark ever poised himself.</p></div>

<p>In some parts the rocks are clothed lavishly with ivy,
the knotted and rugged stems very plainly the growth of
centuries, while the massive upper branches throw themselves
elegantly into the a&euml;rial sea, imitating the glorious
<i>abandon</i> of the strong swimmer when he dives. The
whole of the Lancashire border, at this part, including
the neighbourhood of Burnley, Trawden Forest, and the
Colne district, with the contiguous parts of Yorkshire, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
immensely rich in scenery. Up here, too, it is that one
catches aboriginal Lancashire at its best, the dialect in
its prettiest modifications, and among the rural population
the primitive manners and customs. Towneley
Park, near Burnley, one of the most beautiful of the old
county family seats, is distinguished not more for its
associations than for the abundance of its venerable
trees.</p>

<p>Taking a great bend towards the west, after passing
Stubbins, the line runs through Haslingden, Accrington,
and Blackburn, to a spot of immemorial celebrity. Five
or six miles from the last&ndash;named the Darwen flows
through a secluded vale called Hoghton Bottoms. At
times it is bordered by green and level meads; in certain
parts great lateral walls of rock make it uproarious. The
name refers to the very ancient and distinguished family
seated here ever since the time of Henry II., the residence
up to the middle of the sixteenth century having
been not far from the edge of the water. Doubtless this
would be constructed chiefly or wholly of wood, for the
park, &#8220;in former tyme,&#8221; says the old chronicler, was &#8220;so full
of tymber that a man passing through it could scarcely
have seen the sun shine at mid&ndash;day.&#8221; Soon after the
accession of Elizabeth the existing hall, upon the top of
the hill, was erected, the builder being the celebrated
Thomas Hoghton, who on account of his creed was constrained
to forsake his ancestral home almost immediately
after the completion, and thenceforwards live in exile
upon the Continent. The story of the departure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
unfortunate man is told in the beautiful and pathetic
ballad, &#8220;The Blessed Conscience,&#8221; preserved in the late
Mr. T. T. Wilkinson&#8217;s well&ndash;known volume. It would
seem to have been one of the earliest buildings of the
kind constructed entirely of stone. Perfect in design,
and in excellent preservation, Hoghton Tower presents
to this day, an admirable example of the architecture
of the period, as regards both adaptedness to domestic
use and to defensive purposes. The great quadrangular
lower court is spacious enough for the movement of five
or six hundred men. The upper one gives access to
noble staircases and long galleries, including one for the
minstrels. All that is wanting is the very lofty tower
which in the beginning rose above the central gateway,
and from which the mansion was named. This tower
was accidentally destroyed during the Civil Wars by an
explosion of gunpowder, and there seems never to have
been any disposition to reconstruct it.</p>

<p>A site more charming than that selected by Thomas
Hoghton for the glorious old hall which preserves so
many interesting and old familiar traditions pertaining
to Lancashire, it would be difficult to find. It stands
upon the crest of a gentle slope, from which, as well as
from the windows, we look right away over the plain
and the bright&ndash;faced stream that waters Preston, to the
mountains of the Lake District, these looming grandly
from their curtains of mist; the sea, glorious in the
sheen of sunset, upon the left, and upon the right,
gigantic Pendle. The immediate surroundings are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
less delightful than the prospects; the dell beneath is
one of the kind in which the thin&ndash;tissued flowers of
early spring love to shelter, and which summer fills with
a score of sprightly forms. The eastern side of the hill
is rugged and steep, the Darwen at its foot struggling
with boulders brought down probably by its own
vehemence in remote ages.</p>

<p>The original &#8220;Manchester and Bolton,&#8221; opened as far
back as May 24th, 1838, is now only the first link in
the splendid chain of railway lines which, going nearly
three hundred miles due north, connects our town with
the very heart of Scotland, and by means of the westward
branches, with every part of the shore from the
Mersey to the Clyde. How little was such adventure
dreamed of when the old calmness of the Agecroft valley
was first invaded! Eight years afterwards &#40;April 29th,
1846&#41; it had become the highway to Blackpool, and on
April 7th, 1855, people began to start by it for Southport.
Diverging also to Blackburn, and thence running on to
Clitheroe, a country of wonderful beauty was added
to our already ample choice. Cheshire was discovered
to be by no means the all in all, and in mid&ndash;Lancashire
to&ndash;day we learn anew that in scenery, as in all other
things good for the soul, the secret of beauty comes
of nice balance of complementaries. There is endless
enjoyment also for the arch&aelig;ologist in the old halls up
that way, many of which are scarcely rivalled&mdash;Turton
Tower, for instance, Hall&ndash;i&#8217;th&#8217;&ndash;Wood, and Smithills Hall.
Turton Tower, upon the right of the Clitheroe line, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
square form of which gives it an appearance of great
solidity, is almost sacred, having once been the residence
of Humphrey Chetham. Part of it is stone, part black
and white, the latter with gables, and the storeys successively
overhanging, the former with an embattled parapet.
Inside there are old carved ceilings, with doors of
massive oak, and much besides that talks pleasantly
of the fashions of three hundred years ago. Of late
years a good deal of &#8220;restoration&#8221; has been carried on,
happily with so much judgment that the original features
are in no degree obscured.</p>

<p>Hall&ndash;i&#8217;th&#8217;&ndash;Wood is in its associations one of the most
interesting spots in England, since it was in the large
upper chamber, the one with a window of no fewer than
twenty&ndash;four compartments, that Samuel Crompton constructed
the exquisitely skilful machine upon which the
cotton industry of Lancashire arose to its present magnitude
and importance. The way to it is from the little
wayside station called the &#8220;Oaks,&#8221; crossing the fields, a
pleasant walk of about a mile. The hall stands upon
the edge of a cliff, at the foot of which flows a little
river called the Eagley, one of the early collectors for
the Irwell, the scenery on every side just such as
would recommend the site to that fine old race of country
gentlemen, neither barons nor vassals, under whose
authority marks so enduring as these old Lancashire
halls were impressed upon the land. When Crompton
lived at Hall&ndash;i&#8217;th&#8217;&ndash;Wood, it was embosomed in trees,
many of them so mighty that when cut down it was like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
attacking granite columns. As at Turton, the material
is twofold, a portion being magpie, believed to have
been put together in 1483, while the remainder is grey
stone, erected in 1648; the former, to appearance,
wholly untouched, and the latter altered only by the
introduction, at a little later period than that of the
building of the walls, of some mouldings and other
exterior ornaments. Altogether, the hall is unquestionably
to be regarded as a first&ndash;rate specimen of the style
it illustrates. This is proved by its having often been
taken as a model for modern Elizabethan houses&mdash;we
do not mean by copyists, but by the men of higher
platform&mdash;those with whom knowledge and learning are
never the limit of thought, but only the basis.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Smithills Hall, now the residence of Mr. R. H.
Ainsworth, claims to occupy the site of an ancient
Norman abode, which itself, if all be true in the legends,
succeeded a Saxon palatial one. There can be no doubt
that the spot is one of genuine historical interest. A
chapel, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, was consecrated
at Smithills in 793, nearly a hundred years before the
time of King Alfred; and the locality, like that of
Hall&ndash;i&#8217;th&#8217;&ndash;Wood, is precisely of the kind that would be
selected for their stronghold by the lords then having
authority over the district, being at the head of two or
three beautiful little glens, at once charming in complexion,
and facilitating defence in case of assault.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Much of the original hall has been renewed from time to
time, but it is still a glorious type of the best work of the
sixteenth century, and in the interior, as to antique
carving and other treasures, is rich beyond description.
The gardens also are delightful, and awaken reflections
in the most interesting manner, on the way in which
good planting now&ndash;a&ndash;days links past and present. The
ancient Britons, the oak, the birch, and the hawthorn
are there just as a thousand years ago;&mdash;alongside of
them are the shapely evergreens which modern enterprise
has brought from the Himalayas and Japan. A
pleasant though somewhat round about way to Smithills,
when permission can be obtained to enter,&mdash;a privilege
not to be thought lightly of&mdash;is to go first to Hall&ndash;i&#8217;th&#8217;&ndash;Wood,
then after crossing the Eagley, past Sweetloves, to
Horrocks Fold, and along the edge of the moor, locally
called the Scout, to the top of Deane Road, when the
hall is just below. The distance from Bolton is about
three miles.</p>

<p>Entwistle, the station next beyond Turton, gives access
to a bit of water&ndash;scenery that would scarcely be expected.
Lymm and Hollingworth have prepared us for magnificent
reservoirs; &#8220;Entwistle Lodge,&#8221; the embankment for
which was constructed about fifty years ago, is little
inferior in beauty. As at Lymm, it has given existence
also to a dell beneath, into which, after heavy rain,
causing the water to overflow, there descends a cataract
of at least a hundred and fifty feet fall. The dell is the
only place near Manchester where the lily&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
appears to grow truly wild. In autumn it abounds with
golden&ndash;rod, ferns, hawkweeds, and the blue jasione, and
upon the slopes, as in Hurst Clough, there are many
bushes of the deepest&ndash;coloured of the wild English roses,
the <i>Rosa villosa</i>. A romantic natural dell called
&#8220;The Jumbles,&#8221; near Edgworth, is also rich in wild&ndash;flowers,
but a factory having taken possession, it invites
one no longer.</p>

<p>The valley through which the railway pursues its
course, running on to Darwen, and thence to Blackburn,
is one of those which perfectly illustrates the rich
character of the Lancashire uplands. An excellent idea
of its various wealth is gathered from near the Scout,
when on the way to Smithills, and even while travelling
it is impossible not to perceive how fruitful is every part
in the picturesque, particularly in amphitheatres receding
among the hills, which if somewhat naked, still always
have a cheerful look. All the way, moreover, there is
the noble spectacle of human activity. Langho station,
a quarter of an hour beyond Blackburn, opens the way
once more to pleasing novelty of scene, not to mention
its ancient and beautiful little chapel, the oldest place of
Christian worship in Lancashire still used as one, and from
which it is no more than a pleasant walk of two or three
miles to Whalley itself, the locality of the earliest Christian
preaching in our county. Here it was that Paulinus,
in 627, made his first efforts to convert the Northumbrians&mdash;crosses
in the ancient graveyard commemorate
the event, memorials of pious labour which belong, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
truth, not more to this once lonesome valley than to the
nation. The church, immensely venerable, portions of
it being Norman, is crowded with interesting antiquities,
and would itself well repay the journey, even were there
no Whalley Abbey alongside; say rather the few portions
of the grand old pile that have been spared by Time, and
by that still heavier despoiler, man bent on destruction.
The abbey, founded in 1296, belonged to the Cistercians,
and, as usual with that fraternity, was dedicated to the
Virgin, whence the sacred monogram M still discoverable
upon some of the relics. Like all other abbeys, it
was for more than two hundred and forty years a place of
refuge for every one who needed succour or counsel.
Within its consecrated precincts there was always wisdom
to guide the inexperienced, and charity to relieve the
famishing and distressed. The dissolution of the monasteries
in the calamitous year 1539 by a monarch who
thirsted less for reformation than for spoil, brought everything
to an end; and though the building itself was not
demolished till some time afterwards, the delay was less
designed than accidental. Eventually the very stones
were scattered far and wide; hence there is no identifying
the various portions as we do at Furness, and Fountains,
and Tintern, and Glastonbury, and Rievaulx. The
arch&aelig;ologist conversant with monastic ruins is able to
trace them, but for the ordinary visitor, after the abbot&#8217;s
house, long since modernised, and the two grand old
gateways, there are only a few grey and shattered walls,
some fragments of arches, and broken corridors. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
extent of the abbey grounds, enclosed partly by the river,
partly by an artificial trench or moat, exceeds thirty&ndash;six
acres. The building itself appears to have consisted of
three quadrangles, the westernmost holding the cloisters,
and being edged upon the north by the wall of the
church. There were, in addition, as usual, stables
and outer offices. In the presence of so vast an
extinction, it is pleasant to mark the abundance of
trees now growing within the ancient boundaries;
and more particularly to note the taste with which
in ancient nooks of aisle and corridor, clumps of
green fern have been planted by the owner or resident,
Mr. Appleby. At one time these most interesting
ruins were opened to the public as freely as the
church. Now they are virtually closed, owing to the
misconduct of a party of excursionists&mdash;not from Manchester&mdash;the
innocent, as in so many other places that
have been abused, suffering for the guilty. When will
people privileged to enter a gentleman&#8217;s private grounds
learn to conduct themselves with the same decorum they
would expect others to observe in regard to their own; or
if unpossessed of grounds or gardens, with regard to any
other private property? That the ignorant and selfish
will continue to abuse their privileges to the end of time,
is perhaps only too lamentably certain. Contrariwise,
what a happy day it will be when curiosity in regard
to such places will be synonymous with good manners.
When at Whalley, of course we ascend the Nab, that
beautiful tree&ndash;clad hill which overlooks the abbey, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
gives the first taste of the landscape grandeurs to be
enjoyed later on from the crest of Pendle.</p>

<p>For those who love to feel their feet pressing the turf,
Whalley is the best point of departure also for Stonyhurst,
and for the pretty villages of Great and Little
Mitton, the former upon the opposite bank of the Ribble,
which here separates Lancashire from Yorkshire. The
announcement, when half&ndash;way over the bridge, comes
with most curious unexpectedness. All of a sudden,
while delighting in the sweet spectacle of the stream,
silver&ndash;eddied like the immortal ones in the greatest of
epics, an inscription upon the wall says we are in the
county of the white rose! How can this be? Our
faces are turned westwards! Yorkshire is not in front
of us, but behind! Look at the map, and you will
discover that Mitton stands upon an odd bit which darts
away from all the rest, after traversing which we are
in Lancashire again. Little Mitton Hall is accounted
one of the finest specimens in England of the style of
domestic architecture which prevailed at the commencement
of the sixteenth century, or that of the building of
Henry the Seventh&#8217;s Chapel at Westminster. The basement
is stone, the upper portion timber, including the
roof of the great hall, which is ceiled with oak in wrought
compartments of singular beauty. Great Mitton Church
&#40;in Yorkshire&#41; is no less interesting in respect of its
antiquities and to the admirer of sculpture in the private
chapel, near the altar, once belonging to the Shireburns,
the very ancient and honourable family, long since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
extinct, by which Stonyhurst was founded and originally
occupied. The marble monuments bear epitaphs of rare
tenderness, though antiquated in phraseology, foremost
among them being that which commemorates the last of
the race, Richard Francis Shireburn, who died, poor boy,
in 1702, at the age of only nine&mdash;poisoned, tradition
says, by eating yew&ndash;berries, though as the time of his
death is stated on the monument to have been June, and
it is impossible for yew&ndash;berries to exist except in October
and November, there is something in need of explanation.
It is not, by the way, the yew&ndash;<i>berry</i> that is
poisonous, for that is perfectly innocuous, but the <i>seed</i>.</p>

<p>Stonyhurst needs at least half&ndash;a&ndash;day purely and entirely
to itself. At present, as well known, it is the principal
college maintained in this country by the Jesuits, a party
of whom obtained possession of it in 1794, when driven
from Liege by the terrors of the French Revolution.
The site was occupied by a hall in exceedingly remote
times, a Shireburn going hence in 1347 to attend Queen
Philippa at Calais. The existing edifice was raised in
the time of Elizabeth, by whom the head of the family
was so highly esteemed, that although a Catholic, she
allowed him to retain his private oratory and domestic
priest. The lofty and battlemented centre and the noble
cupolas give it a character among our Lancashire mansions
quite unique. The interior is in perfect harmony
with the external design. It is richly stored, moreover,
with works of art, and with arch&aelig;ological and historical
curiosities, the latter including various treasures brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
from the continent at the time of the establishment of
the college. The present refectory was the old state
reception hall, left unfinished through the death of the
builder of this splendid place, magnificent nevertheless in
its incompleteness, especially in regard to the ceiling and
the friezes. Of late years very considerable additions
have been made to the building, so as to adapt it more
thoroughly to educational use of the highest character,
and these, happily, are all consistent with the original
scheme of decoration as well of architectural plan.
Visitors are allowed to go through on making previous
and proper application.</p>

<p>A more delightful neighbourhood for a great residence
it would be difficult to find. Everywhere in the vicinity
alike of Stonyhurst and of the two Mittons, the country
constantly reminds one of the south. Upon foot it is
impossible to go astray, for if in rambling we do not
reach the particular point that was contemplated at the
outset, meadows, running water, woodlands, and the
sweet spectacle of hills, both near and distant, and of all
chaste hues, are everywhere our own, and the last hour
is no less animating than the first. A very lovely walk
in particular is that one from Mitton to Clitheroe,
keeping the Lancashire side of the stream. The babble
of the broad and shining water, the patient expectancy of
many anglers, majestic Pendle upon the right, a thousand
green trees, and by turning the head a little, after the
manner of</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;travellers oft, at evening&#8217;s close,<br />
When eastwards slowly moving,</p></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the glimpse still obtainable of lofty Stonyhurst, which
ever and anon recalls the inimitable ode, &#8220;Ye distant
spires, ye antique towers.&#8221; Each and every element in
turn invites a pause, and linger as one may, Clitheroe is
still too near, and reached too soon.</p>

<p>Arrived, there is new pleasure in inspection of the
remains of the ancient castle, one of the most interesting
feudal relics in the county,&mdash;built towards the close
of the twelfth century by one of the De Lacy family,
whose landed possessions extended from this neighbourhood
uninterruptedly to Pontefract. It never was a
castle in the thorough sense of the word, merely a
stronghold to which the lords of the house came at
intervals, to receive tribute and to dispense justice.
There never was room for much more than a donjon,
the rock upon which the little fortalice was erected,
rising out of the flat like an islet, a sort of Beeston rock
in miniature. There were buildings no doubt upon the
slope, predecessors of the present, the former including a
chapel, but these were quite external to the castle
<i>ipsissima</i>. The view from the summit is delightfully
picturesque, and when this has been enjoyed, there is, as
at Smithills, that curious blending of past and present,
old and new, which always awakens gratitude to the
gardener, for here, in this ancient keep, leaning against
stones laid in their places nearly eight centuries ago, is
one of the glossy little cotoneasters of northern India,
unknown in England before 1825.</p>

<p>From Clitheroe we do well to proceed to Chatburn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
by rail, if preferred, but far preferably on foot. Going
about half&ndash;a&ndash;mile along the highway, presently, upon the
left, there is a gate into a downward&ndash;sloping field, the
path through which is continued under a flat railway
bridge, then past the first of the celebrated Chatburn
quarries, and into the fields again. Or we may go along
the foot of mighty Pendle itself, and along a series of
narrow and winding green lanes to Downham. The
Chatburn quarries are capital hunting&ndash;grounds for the
student of fossil shells, encrinites, and other remains
found in limestone. We are enjoined to &#8220;consider the
lilies of the field&#8221;&mdash;not foreign to the Divine behest is it
to consider the Crinoidea, the wonderful stone&ndash;lilies of
the limestone rock, the petrified flower&ndash;like heads of
which here occur in inexpressible abundance. The great
stones set up edgeways in place of stiles between the
fields near the quarries, are crowded with fragments,
and show the rough condition of a favourite material for
chimneypieces. For the sake of ladies who may think
of going this way, it may be well to add that the vertical
stone barriers in question were plainly erected in defiance
of the art of dress.</p>

<p>Chatburn is the point to start from when the top of
Pendle is the object, a rather heavy climb of two miles
and a half, but if the atmosphere be clear, well rewarded.
The view from Whalley Nab was magnificent. Pendle
is to the latter just what Cobden Edge is to Marple&mdash;a
brow upon which the former grandeurs seem diminished
to a fifth. The glistening waters of the Irish Sea beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the broad green plain in front; in the north, dim vistas
and dark peaks, or mild blue masses, that declare the
mountains of the Lake District,&mdash;old Coniston tossing the
clouds from his hoary brows; proximately the smiling
valley of the Ribble, the whole of the upper portion of
which is overlooked; of the Hodder also, in temperament
so wild and dashing, and the wandering Calder; and,
turning to the east, the land towards the German Ocean
as far as the powers of the eye can reach. The highest
point of this huge mountain&mdash;the most prominent feature
in the physical geography of mid&ndash;Lancashire&mdash;is stated
by the Ordnance Survey to be one thousand eight
hundred and fifty feet, thus falling very little short
of the loftiest part of Kinder Scout, which nowhere claims
a full two thousand. Keeping to the level, there is endless
recreation, whether we penetrate Ribblesdale, or
cross the river at the ferry, a mile below, for the fragments
of Sawley, or content ourselves with the peaceful
borders. Not what the Ribble is at &#8220;proud Preston,&#8221;
some seven leagues lower down, a broad and majestic
river, do we find it here, but rural, chaste, and tranquil,
the water shallow and clear, the <i>beau&ndash;ideal</i> of a Peneus,
the laurels only wanting.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CAMDEN, in his famous seventeenth century
tour, says that he approached Lancashire
from Yorkshire, &#8220;that part of the country
lying beyond the mountains towards the
western ocean,&#8221; with &#8220;a kind of dread,&#8221; but
trusted to Divine Providence, which, he
said, &#8220;had gone with him hitherto,&#8221; to help him in the
attempt. His apprehensions arose, no doubt, partly
upon the immense difficulties which in those days
attended travelling; but Lancashire west of the Rivington
range was, in its rural portions, at the same period
almost as rude and cheerless as Connemara. Towards
the sea there were vast expanses of moor and marsh, and
even the inland parts were cold and inhospitable. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
changed by the wand of that greatest of magicians,
Commerce! Though there is still abundant need of
polish, Camden himself, could he come back, would
surrender his fears, let him only be one of a party up
to the Pike. Conspicuous from a hundred spots on
the western margin of our city, Rivington Pike is little
less worthy of a visit than Pendle, and has the advantage
over the latter in being comparatively near. Proceeding
first to Horwich, six miles beyond Bolton, on the main
northern line, the ascent is quite easy, and may be undertaken
by two or three different routes&mdash;one by the side
of the little river Douglas; another by the quarry and
Tiger Wood, a deep ravine containing all the accustomed
pretty features of Lancashire mountain defiles, rushing
water, many cascades, and abundance of trees. Ferns,
mosses, and sylvan wild&ndash;flowers grow in plenty, and in one
part, where the water collects in a large natural pool, there
is quite a remarkable display of aquatic plants. The
summit gained, over fifteen hundred feet above the sea,
the prospect is magnificent, especially if we delay till the
green country glows with a summer evening&#8217;s sunset.
The great plain that stretches to the Ribble, and renews
itself as the &#8220;Fylde,&#8221; lies at our feet. Chorley and
Preston seem quite close; in the distance the church&ndash;towers
and other aspiring portions of Southport are
plainly visible, and beyond all there is a shining streak
that is unmistakably the play&ndash;ground of the sea&ndash;gulls.
North Cheshire, North Wales, and the nearer Derbyshire
hills, are also seen. A very particularly fine view is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
obtained from the Anglezark end of the hill, a rough
and broken eminence reached by a zigzag path from the
base, which leads eventually to a soft and turfy brow.
Upon the opposite side of the field, a trifle higher, there
is a wall with a narrow iron gate in it, and here we take
our stand. Now and then, on fine and perfectly tranquil
evenings towards sunset, Lancaster Castle may be distinguished;
if the tide be in, Morecambe Bay, and even
Coniston.</p>

<p>Quite as interesting, every way, as the Pike, and more
so in some respects, are the great reservoirs belonging to
the Liverpool Waterworks, altogether out of sight from
the railway, but as a spectacle from the hill&ndash;side undeniably
one of the most charming in the county. The area
of the entire water&ndash;surface is five hundred acres; the
supply comes from ten thousand acres of moorland
above, brought down chiefly by the little rivers called the
Douglas, the Yarrow, and the Roddlesworth. The Act
of Parliament authorising the construction of these great
reservoirs was obtained in 1847. Water was first
delivered from them in Liverpool January 2nd, 1857.
Rivington Pike, after all, is not the highest point of the
range. Winter Hill, well named, so wild and cold and
dreary is the complexion, and so often is it beaten by
storms, claims a considerably greater altitude.</p>

<p>By this same line we go also to Chorley for Whittle&ndash;le&ndash;Woods,
distant only four miles from Hoghton Tower, a
romantic and secluded spot, noted for its historical
associations, its &#8220;Springs,&#8221; and, if we care to pursue a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
quiet and pretty walk by the edge of the canal, for wild&ndash;flowers
found nowhere else near Manchester. Excepting
in the canal at Disley, there is not another within the
distance where there are in particular so many pond&ndash;weeds,
that beautiful plant the <i>lucens</i> leading the way.
Of these submerged things the question has been asked
perhaps more frequently than of any others, What use
are they? Rest upon them, then, for a moment. Use
is a triple idea. Taking the entire mass of the vegetation
of our planet, first there is economic use, as for food,
which last being rendered to brute creatures as well as to
mankind, is at the best but at a low and menial one.
Secondly, comes the admirable use subserved by beauty,
which brutes are incapable of appreciating, and blindness
to which, like the use of foul and profane language,
may be taken perhaps as the infallible sign of an imbecile.
Plants can never be truly learned, nor is their highest use
realised so long as we rest in the contemplation, albeit
so salutary, even of their loveliness. Their last and crowning
use comes of their <i>interpreting</i> power. There is not
a species that does not cast some welcome side&ndash;light, that
does not open our understanding to something previously
unperceived. The pond&ndash;weeds do this, if nothing below,
so that meeting with them we may rejoice.</p>

<p>The fine old halls scattered so freely about Bolton
have counterparts in the neighbourhood of Wigan, all
this part of the county having been in the hands of
wealthy men during the time of the Stuarts and of the
Commonwealth. Ince Hall, black and white, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
five gables, though of late much disfigured; Lostock
Old Hall, Standish, Pemberton, Birchley, and Winstanley,
are all very interesting; and if Haigh Hall, the Lancashire
seat of the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, be
less curious, arch&aelig;ologically, there is not one that will
compare with it in respect of gardens or romantic
approach. The walk through the wood, beginning at a
mile from the Wigan market&ndash;place, is in its way, for so
near a coal and factory centre, without a rival.</p>

<p>For a charming bit of wild nature thereabouts, commend
us, however, to Dean Wood. Nothing, as regards
landscape and prospects of sylvan solitude, can be more
unpromising than the approach thereto through Hindley
and Wigan. Two or three miles beyond the latter,
where the ground begins to rise, and trees and streams
of water make their appearance, it seems possible, after
all, that something picturesque may lie concealed; and
leaving the line at Gathurst, sure enough, we are by no
means disappointed. Turning up on the left, after a
few minutes along field&ndash;paths, the way changes into a
beautiful clough, in many respects not unlike Bamford
Wood, and which goes on improving to the end. Of
course it is not to be confounded with the Dean Wood
upon the slopes of Rivington; nor is the river below to
be confounded with the Rivington &#8220;Douglas.&#8221; This
one, in truth, is the Lancashire Douglas pre&ndash;eminently:
a stream of fifteen miles&#8217; flow before entering the Ribble,
and the same with which tradition connects bloody
conflicts in the time of the Danes. A tributary comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
down the wood, after rain often so much swollen as to
drown the path beside, when we may take an upper one,
every bit as enjoyable, especially in autumn, since it gives
a charming view of the trees below, among which there
is unusual plenty of the kinds that bear red berries.
Ferns and mosses grow in equal abundance; wild&ndash;flowers
also, and flowering shrubs. The Gueldres&ndash;rose is
especially abundant, and upon one occasion&mdash;October
10th, 1868&mdash;the ground was strewed in certain spots with
the fallen fruit of the wild apple. In the upper part of
the wood there are some curious varieties of the common
oak, the leaves so small that they might be thought to
belong to a different species. Emerging near the green
lane, the homeward path lies first through Up&ndash;Holland,
then either by the lanes to Wigan&mdash;four miles distant&mdash;or
more speedily to Orrel station on the Bolton and
Liverpool line.</p>

<p>Appley Bridge, the station succeeding Gathurst, is the
nearest for that glorious eminence, Ashurst Hill, the
prospect from which is once again all that heart can
desire, let only the day be fair. Now, too, we have something
quite different, the great flat, looking southwards,
being that which reaches to the estuary of the Mersey,
the eye resting upon the distant trees of Knowsley Park,
and detecting even Liverpool; while to the west, almost
underneath, is Lathom, Ormskirk beyond, and exquisitely
upon the horizon, the lucid sea, and the mountains that
talk quietly of the Vale of Llangollen. A similar view
is obtainable from the summit of Billinge, half&ndash;way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
between Wigan and St. Helens, but access thereto is not
so easy, nor is there the same sweet sense of remote and
airy solitude, green as the early spring, which, unless the
visit happens to be most unfortunately timed, always
awaits the pilgrim to Ashurst. The beacon upon the
summit, a stone tower with pyramidal spire, was erected
in the time of the French Revolutionary wars, taking
the place of one established on the identical spot in the
memorable August of 1588,&mdash;the year, as Charles
Kingsley says, of Britain&#8217;s Salamis.</p>

<p>From Appley Bridge there is also a grand walk to the
summits upon the <i>right&ndash;hand</i> side of the rails, the chief of
them, Horrocks Hill, lying about two miles away to the
north, and at a spot called Higher Barn, attaining an
elevation superior even to Ashurst. But it is not so well
adapted for a signalling station, and hence, instead of a
beacon, is marked only by a tree. The view from the
top is singularly fine, embracing the whole country up to
the Lune, with the towers of Lancaster city, Blackpool,
Rufford &#40;where there is a very interesting old hall, black
and white&#41;, the Ribble, and the entire course of the
Douglas, embouchure included. For variety, the return
walk may be made <i>vi&acirc;</i> Standish.</p>

<p>Lathom Park implies, upon the Newborough side, a
delicious walk through the intricacies of what in this part
would be better called Lathom Wood. The trees are
lofty; the shade is dense; the path, gently undulated,
crosses about the middle a swiftly&ndash;running stream called
the Sawd. This, like the water in Dean Wood, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
tributary of the Douglas. Just outside the park there is
another, now called the Slate Brook, and of special
historical interest, being that one which in the records of
the memorable siege of Lathom House is called the
Golforden.</p>

<p>Shortly after emerging from the wood, and crossing
the smooth greensward of the park where open to the
sunshine, the house itself comes in view, a noble mansion,
worthy alike of the domain and of the owner. That it
is not the original Lathom House&mdash;the Lathom which
belongs not more to the history of Lancashire than to the
annals of English courage and to the biography of great&ndash;souled
women, scarcely needs saying. The original,&mdash;the
magnificent building honoured by the visit of Henry VII.
and his queen, when the &#8220;singing women&#8221; walked in
front,&mdash;which had no fewer than eighteen towers, in
addition to the lofty &#8220;eagle,&#8221; and a fosse of eight yards
in width, received so much injury at the time of the siege
that on the removal of the family, shortly afterwards, to
Knowsley, it soon fell into a state of utter dilapidation.
Passing into the hands of the Bootle family, restoration
was found impracticable, and during the ten years following
1724 the present building superseded the historic one.
Nothing in its style can be finer than the north front,
one hundred and fifty&ndash;six feet long, rising from a massive
rustic basement, with double flight of steps to the first
story, the lateral portions supported by Ionic columns.
The interior corresponds; the great hall being forty feet
square, with a height of thirty feet; the saloon, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
almost similar dimensions, and the library fifty feet by
twenty. When given over to decay, the original hall was
literally carried off stone by stone, the country people in
the vicinity being permitted to take whatever they liked
for private use, so that now, as has happened with many
an ancient abbey and castle, the building may be said to
be diffused over the whole district. In farmyard and
cottage walls it is not difficult to identify now and then,
on a very fair basis of conjecture, a fragment or two of
the ancestral home of the Stanleys, every atom suggestive,
as we contemplate it, of ancient dignity and heroism
almost unique.</p>

<p>To recite, once again, the majestic old story of the
siege is not needful. Suffice it to say that in 1642, when
James, the seventh Earl of Derby, whose steadfast loyalty
so well fulfilled the family motto, <i>Sans changer</i>, was in the
Isle of Man, approach was made to Lathom House with
a view to capture by the Parliamentarians under Fairfax.
The countess, originally Charlotte de Tremouille, a high&ndash;born
lady whose kindred were connected with the blood&ndash;royal
of France, replied to the summons to surrender
that she had a double trust to sustain&mdash;faith to her lord
the Earl, who had entrusted her with the safe keeping,
and allegiance to her king&mdash;and that she was resolved
not to swerve from either honour or obedience. The
nature of the long defence, the discomfiture of the
assailants, and what happened subsequently, constitutes,
as well known, a chapter in the family history at once
consummately noble and profoundly sorrowful. It reads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
more touchingly than any romance or tale of fancy, and
would supply subjects for many a great picture. Plenty
of memorials of the siege have been preserved. A little
while ago, upon removal of a tree near the site of the
original hall, numbers of bullets were found in the earth
about the roots. Tradition also has plenty to say, and
apparently with more truth than is sometimes the case.
In the history of the siege, written shortly after its time,
seven of the defenders are said to have lost their lives,
and one of these, called on account of his great stature,
Long Jan, is said to have owed his death&ndash;wound to his
head rising above the wall or parapet. Very interesting
was it, therefore, a few years since, when during some alterations
in the level of the ground, there were discovered
seven skeletons, one of them indicating a frame little less
than gigantic. The bones, when uncovered, were seemingly
perfect, but all soon crumbled away, and not a trace
remained. Another circumstance mentioned in the old
history of the siege is that supplies of coal were obtained
by excavating in the courtyard. The Earl of Lathom
was so fortunate, a year or two ago, as to personally
prove the truthfulness of this statement by the discovery
of an outcrop below the turf, just in front of the drawing&ndash;room
windows of the modern mansion.</p>

<p>The Lathom pleasure&ndash;grounds and gardens are not less
beautiful than the wood. In the former, among many
other rare and admirable trees, there is a plane, in Lancashire
quite a stranger; this one the very emblem of
health and nobleness, a sight, as Dame Quickly says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
&#8220;to thank God on:&#8221; the latter teem with interesting hardy
herbaceous plants, quite refreshing to behold after the
inlay of chromatic geometry which at the present day is
so often substituted for a garden. The flowers, in great
abundance and variety, are chiefly of the kinds that the
poets and artists always loved, those that have been sung
of in a thousand simple verses, which the poets still
love best of all, and which, when neatly and nicely
marshalled and tended, keep up an unrelaxing flow of
tinted loveliness from the time of Christmas&ndash;roses and
yellow aconites until that of the last lingering asters of
November. Access to this charming place is for the
favoured few not beyond the range of the possibilities.
Never yet, when properly asked, has the Earl of Lathom
refused to give proof of generous courtesy such as
distinguishes the Lancashire gentleman and the English
nobleman.</p>

<p>Not far from Lathom Park there is another very interesting
old family seat, Blythe Hall, the residence of
the Hon. Mrs. Bootle&ndash;Wilbraham. This is approached
most pleasantly from Burscough, through lanes, meadows,
and corn&ndash;fields, and in its garden, like Lathom, and, we
may add, like Cheshire Tatton, gives delightful guarantee
that, despite the enmity of modern planters, genuine floriculture
will, with the tasteful, outlive them all. There
are fit and proper places, no doubt, for every style and
system of flower&ndash;planting. Any mode that pleases a
considerable number of rational people is proved, by the
simple fact of its doing so, to be right under certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
conditions, local ones, and limited. The misfortune is
that &#8220;bedding&ndash;out&#8221; very generally implies, if it does not
necessitate, the abolition of a thousand things that are
individually and supremely meritorious, the piece of land
which it embosses becoming only by a euphemism, &#8220;a
garden,&#8221; and this at infinitely greater pains than if
cultivated.</p>

<p>When at Blythe, it would be a pity to forget that at a
few fields&#8217; distance remains exist to this day of the once
celebrated and stately Burscough Priory. The fragments,
for they really are no more, consist of portions of one of
the principal interior arches, deeply sunk in the mass of
earth and rubbish accumulated after the overthrow of the
building, the arched head of a piscina alone declaring the
ancient level. The ruins seem to have stood untouched
and grey, as at this moment, for at least a couple of
centuries. The grass comes up to their feet, and looks
as if it had been there always. Very interesting, however,
is it to note, close by, orchards comparatively
young, in their season full of honey&ndash;plums and damsons;
corn also, within a few yards, the fruit and the grain
renewing to&ndash;day what no doubt was the exact spectacle
five hundred years ago. The priory was founded by
Robert Fitz&ndash;Henry, lord of Lathom, temp. Richard I.
It was richly endowed, and at the time of the suppression
required as many as forty servants. Some of the
Stanley monuments, and eight of the bells, were then
removed to Ormskirk church, where a new tower was
built for the reception of the latter, the remainder going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to Croston. The mutilated alabaster effigies of knights
and ladies from the old Derby burial&ndash;place, form one of
the most interesting of the many attractions of remarkable
Ormskirk. Excepting a few portraits, these effigies,
strange to say, are the only extant art memorials of that
ancient line! A tablet, an epitaph, even a gravestone in
honour of a Derby of the lang syne, is sought in vain.
Knowsley, the present seat of the family, seven miles
from Liverpool and two from Prescot, is celebrated for
the magnitude, rather than the symmetry, of its splendid
hall. Built at very various times, it presents as many
different styles. The park, nine or ten miles in circumference,
abounds with pretty bits of the picturesque given
by trees. Many of these, however, have the curious look
presented by such as growing near the shore, are
constantly wind&ndash;beaten.</p>

<p>From various points near Lathom and Ormskirk there
is seen, in the Southport direction, to all appearance a
village spire. This indicates, in reality, Scarisbrick Hall,
one of the most striking and successful efforts in architecture
the county possesses. The ancestors of the
Scarisbrick family having owned the estates for at least
seven centuries, we learn without surprise that, as in
other cases, where the present building now stands there
was once a black and white; further, that the family
being Catholic, it was well provided with outer defences,
and had its &#8220;secret chamber&#8221; for refuge in times of
persecution. The original was in 1799 the residence of
the philanthropic Mr. Eccleston at whose cost and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
whose guidance Martin Mere was reclaimed. In 1814
all was changed. The old timbered building was cased
in stone so completely that now not a trace remains in
view; and the general form, a centre with projecting
wings, is all that exists in the shape of memorial. But
how magnificently effected! The work was entrusted to
the elder Pugin, and continued by his son, without stint
as to cost, the result being an edifice in the Tudor style,
treated with power and opulence so astonishing that all
ordinary domestic buildings of similar character seem by
comparison insignificant. Sculptures and every kind of
decorative stone&ndash;work contribute to the wonderful beauty
of the vast exterior. Along the base of the enriched
cornices or parapets scripture texts have been introduced&mdash;&#8220;I
have raised up the ruins, and I have
builded it as in the days of old;&#8221; &#8220;Every house is builded
by some man, but He that buildeth all is God;&#8221;&mdash;the
ample windows, in their turn, are freely traced with lines
and patterns of shining gold. The superb tower, which
in the distance seems a village spire, erected about a
dozen years ago, is over one hundred and sixty feet in
height, and is understood to be an exact copy of the
Victoria Tower of the Houses of Parliament. The cost
of this portion alone approached the sum of &pound;25,000.
Gardens and conservatories add to the interest of this
splendid place; the former containing a holly, the stem
of which, at twenty inches above the ground, is six feet
in circumference; while the latter are renowned for their
tropical ferns. The very low situation, and the flatness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of all the surrounding country, unfortunately prevent this
noble building being seen to advantage. It is a
marvel, nevertheless, to all who approach. The Scarisbrick
family has of late years experienced changes. The
present owner of the hall, by marriage to the daughter
of the Lady Scarisbrick who died in 1872, is the Marquis
de Blandos de Cast&egrave;ja.</p>

<p>Southport should be visited for the sake of its unusually
good Aquarium, with Winter Gardens above, a
flower&ndash;show all the year round; for the beautiful Churchtown
Botanical Gardens, the fernery belonging to which
has no rival, as regards our own neighbourhood, except
at Tatton; and for the Birkdale sandhills, no dreary place
except to the dreary&ndash;hearted, but in their way so remarkable
and picturesque, so richly stored with curious plants,
and breathing an air so soft and salubrious that in the
north of England they stand alone. In their wild
and ever&ndash;changing complexion they supply enjoyments
quite distinct from the uniformity of a corn and
pastoral country. Standing upon their spear&ndash;clad
ridges, we seem to be surveying a miniature Cordillera.
In winter the northward and eastward slopes are flecked
with snow, while the southern and western ones bask in
the sunshine; mosses of all shades of green and coppery&ndash;gold
strew the former parts with little islands of sweet
brightness; and in July the open plateaux are crowded
with the white cups of the parnassia. Up to about twenty
years ago, no place in the entire county, excepting
Grange, was so rich for the botanist as Southport in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
general. Building, drainage, and the changes incident
to town&ndash;extension, have obliterated many of the best
localities; still, so long as the Birkdale sandhills remain
intact, it will preserve no trifling part of the reputation.
The want at Southport is more sea. The tide not only
goes out to an incredible distance, but always seems
reluctant to return. It is in respect of this that
superiority is so justly claimed by Blackpool, the sea at
the latter place, save on exceptional days, being always
within view, always grand and inspiring.</p>

<p>South Lancashire, <i>vi&acirc;</i> the original Liverpool and Manchester
line, or that which runs through Barton, offers
few attractions to the excursionist, being flat and very
seldom relieved by wood and water. The best part of
the country traversed by the line in question is that which
holds Worsley Hall, the seat of the Earl of Ellesmere,
the ground here rising into a terrace which commands
a view over the whole of the great plain bounded upon
the opposite side by Dunham Park. The summit of the
lofty tower at Wren&#8217;s Wood, a little to the west of the
hall, overlooks or allows of glimpses of no fewer than
six counties. Hence it is itself seen from great distances.
The grounds pertaining to the hall, access to which
is granted at certain times, supply an excellent example
of high&ndash;class professional laying&ndash;out, without exciting the
sense of surfeit such as at Alton is scarcely avoidable.
The woodland paths are pretty, and in autumn the floricultural
part emulates even Vale Royal. The hall, just
beyond the village, upon the left hand, is the third of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
name. The original, or &#8220;Old&#8221; hall, a most interesting,
quaintly&ndash;timbered structure, still exists, and is at present
occupied by the Hon. Algernon Egerton. The second
was pulled down about twenty years ago. The present
magnificent structure, so conspicuous from the railway,
was commenced in or about 1839 by the first Earl
of Ellesmere, then Lord Francis Egerton, under the
superintendence of Mr. Blore, the architect of the new
fa&ccedil;ade of Buckingham Palace. Upon the right&ndash;hand
side of the road, after emerging from the village, there is
a very pretty sylvan adjunct to the park called the Hen
Pen, the paths meandering through which often recall
the scenery of Mere Clough. The village itself is exceptionally
picturesque, the late Earl having encouraged the
erection of private houses and other buildings in the
style of the old hall, the ancient black and white or
&#8220;magpie&#8221; fashion, these gaining in turn from the
happily chosen position of the church, which last is
considered to be one of the most successful productions
of Mr. Gilbert Scott, and is in any case a most beautiful
example of Geometrical Decorated. Worsley may be
reached by three different routes. First, there is the
station of its own name, upon the Tyldesley line, going
thence across the fields. Secondly, there is the old way
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Patricroft, proceeding thence on foot by the side of
the canal, a walk of about two miles. Thirdly, when
permission can be obtained, there is the delightful path
through Botany Bay Wood, one of the most sequestered
to be found anywhere near Manchester. Being strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
preserved, it is of course only at certain seasons, and
then only by special favour, that people are allowed to
pass through, or can reasonably ask for leave. The
entrance to it is from Barton Moss, beginning with the
station, then crossing the waste at right angles, so as to
step on to a broad causeway which borders the moss
in a line parallel with the rails, and after becoming
greener and softer, at last enters the wood. Filling the
whole of the space between the grounds of Worsley Hall
and the edge of the moss, and of purely artificial origin,
this charming leafy covert received its somewhat singular
name from the workmen by whose labour it was formed.
So arduous was the toil demanded by the draining and
subsequent planting, that they compared it to the penalty
of transportation to the eighty years ago famous &#8220;Botany
Bay&#8221; of the antipodes, the terror of evil doers, and
precursor of the Dartmoor of to&ndash;day. Barton Moss is
essentially a portion or adjunct of Chat Moss, an element
of the landscape as surveyed from the higher parts of
Worsley, which can hardly be considered cheerful, though
rich in interesting associations, foremost among which is
the history of the means adopted to overcome the difficulties
it presented to the constructors of the original
Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The naturalist still
finds upon it abundance of welcome objects, including
the bog&ndash;myrtle, <i>Myrica Gal&euml;</i>, one of the very few really
indigenous British plants which can be rightfully called
aromatic. A surface like Chat Moss, saturated with wet,
seems in little danger of ignition, yet no further back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
than in June, 1868, a very considerable portion was on
fire. The conflagration commenced in a plantation near
Astley. Within an hour most of the trees were levelled
with the ground. A strong wind was blowing at the time,
the fire spread rapidly, and the flames and clouds of
smoke were seen for miles. Continuing for between four
and five days, at last it approached Barton, and only then
did it die away. The moss is traversed hereabouts by
many ditches cut for draining purposes. They are from
five to eight feet wide, and twelve to fifteen feet in depth,
and are generally full of water. So powerful, however,
was the action of the fire, that when it expired in many
of them there was scarcely an inch, and others were
entirely dry. A conflagration of similar character
occurred in 1790 upon Lindow Common, resulting in
the destruction of an enormous quantity of the game
then so plentiful there.</p>

<p>Newton&ndash;le&ndash;Willows, a place of more names than any
other in the county, being also called Newton Bridge,
and Newton&ndash;in&ndash;Makerfield, and by sporting men simply
Newton, all these superseding the ancient &#8220;Rokeden,&#8221;
gives access to interesting places both right and left.
The town itself has its attractions, consisting of little
more than the one old original broad street, with plenty
of arch&aelig;ological curiosities, which preserves the primitive
idea of a rural English village. Some very pleasant
walks, partly sylvan, invite us to the northern side, where
also will be found a large and picturesque sheet of water.
Like Taxal and Rudyard it is artificial, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
formed by barricading the outlets of two small streams&mdash;the
Dene and the Sankey&mdash;which previously occupied
little independent valleys of their own, so that the outline
of the &#8220;lake&#8221; so called, is most agreeably irregular.
In parts it is abundantly flowered with water&ndash;lilies,
so easy is it for good taste to confer a pure and lasting
ornament. On the southern side of the line the
specialty consists in the very ancient and interesting
village of Winwick, with its celebrated church and innumerable
antiquities, including a runic cross in the
graveyard. Thence, by permission, there is a charming
walk towards Warrington, first along the old lane in front
of the church, then through the grounds and shrubberies
attached to Winwick Hall, after leaving which the path
becomes public. The rhododendrons at Winwick Hall
are probably the oldest, as they are certainly the largest
and finest in the district. They give one a perfect idea of
the stalwart vitality of this inestimable flowering shrub,
and place it before us, in all likelihood, just as developed
in its native valleys upon the borders of the Euxine, all
these very large and venerable rhododendrons, wherever
seen, being the original <i>Ponticum</i>. While the original
&#8220;anemone&#8221; was the flower we now call the cistus, the
original &#8220;rhododendron&#8221; was after all, not our universal
garden favourite so named, but a totally different thing&mdash;the
shrub, originally from Palestine, cherished in greenhouses
as the &#8220;oleander.&#8221; Such, at least, was the
application of the name in the times immediately preceding
those when Pliny wrote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>On the extreme south&ndash;western margin of the county,
where the simple rustic streams we found near Marple,
the Goyt and the Etherowe, after uniting their strength,
and receiving the waters of the Tame, the Irwell, and the
Bollin, at length become glorious as the estuary of the
Mersey, there remain for us, in conclusion, two of the
most interesting places in Lancashire. These are Speke
Hall, near Garston, and the village of Hale; the latter
possessed of some fine arch&aelig;ological fragments, with,
close by, the park and gardens appertaining to the
residence of Colonel Blackburne.</p>

<p>Speke Hall is a most charming example of genuine
Elizabethan work, affording, both inside and out, some
of the best and most characteristic features of the better
kind of domestic architecture which came into general
use soon after the middle of the sixteenth century. To
compare small things with great, it may be described as
a miniature Bramhall. It stands only a few minutes&#8217;
walk from the edge of the estuary, and in the olden time
would often, no doubt, be approached from the water, to
which an avenue or arcade of lofty trees at present
shows the way. In front the ground is level, consisting
of green fields which reach to the garden fence. The
want of elevation, as at Scarisbrick, rather hinders full
appreciation of the singular beauty of the building, at all
events until we draw near enough to perceive that, like
nearly all other mansions of the kind, it was originally
protected by a moat. This has long since been
superseded by turf, the bridge alone remaining to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the depth and width, and the grand old structure now
rising up in all its nobleness of design. It is not the
original Speke Hall. At the period of the Domesday
survey the estate was held by a Saxon thane. After the
Conquest, it fell to the share of that famous Norman,
Roger de Poictou, who as a reward for his conduct at
the battle of Hastings, received so large a portion of
Lancashire. Roger, as we all remember, took part in
sundry small acts of disloyalty, for which, in turn, he was
punished by forfeiture. Subsequently changing hands
yet again, at last&mdash;perhaps about 1350&mdash;the property
came to be owned by a branch of the celebrated old
family of Norreys &#40;one of the descendants of which
fought under Lord Stanley at Flodden, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1513&#41;, and
by these the first hall of the name was erected, in what
style is not known. Remaining in their possession,
Speke, as we see it to&ndash;day, was the work of one Edward
Norreys, who commemorates himself in an inscription in
antique letters over the principal entrance:&mdash;&#8220;This worke
25 yards long was wolly built by Edw. N., Esq. Anno
1598.&#8221; The ground&ndash;plan, as in similar halls, consisted
of a spacious quadrangular courtyard, buildings occupying
all four of the sides, so that by means of the corridors
and galleries, any portion can be reached by an inmate
without stepping into the open air. The richness of
these corridors, the beauty of the wood&ndash;carving, and the
general ornamentation, it is impossible to describe briefly;
some of the carved oak was brought from Holyrood by
the Sir Wm. Norreys of Flodden fame. There is a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
collection also of ancient weapons, miscellaneous curiosities,
and paintings. A wonderful and probably unique
spectacle, as regards our own country, is presented upon
entering the quadrangle. A very considerable portion
of its large area is occupied by a pair of yew trees, much
older than the building itself, and to accommodate
which the builder seems to have given his first thought
while measuring, not forgetting that while his walls
would remain unchanged, the trees would grow. They
are not of the same age. The yew being one of the
trees which are distinctly unisexual, it is plain that the
object in introducing the second individual was to
secure red berries, such as are still produced abundantly
every year. In 1736 the Speke estate passed, through a
marriage, into the hands of one of the Beauclerk family,
concerning whom the historians seem to care to say no
more than is needful; and in 1780 it was purchased by
Mr. Richard Watt, an opulent Liverpool merchant.
Continuing in his family, it is now held by the lady&mdash;Miss
Ada Watt&mdash;whose kindly permission to enter the
gates is indispensable.</p>

<i>Hale Hut.</i></p>
<p class="largeimg"><a href="images/i_281_large.jpg">Larger image</a> &#40;170 kB&#41;</p>
</div>

<p>Hale, renowned for its cottage&ndash;gardens, with lilies and
roses beyond the counting, is a quiet, peaceful, salubrious
little place, claiming celebrity as regards historical mention
long anterior to that of Liverpool. When the site
of that wealthy city was known to few but fishermen,
Hale, so its people assert, already possessed a royal
charter. To&ndash;day the arch&aelig;ologist turns with interest to
the remains of a mansion which in its way must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
been a fitting companion even for Speke&mdash;the ancient
baronial residence called the Hutte, about two miles
upon the Liverpool side of the village, and lying back a
little distance from the turnpike road. The great hall
was a hundred feet long by thirty feet wide; scarcely
anything is to be seen now beyond some of the grand
old windows, an ancient chimneypiece, and the moat,
with its drawbridge. Hale Church, like the Hutte, tells
of a time when the maps did not insert Liverpool.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The
body dates from about the middle of the last century,
but the tower is of immemorial age, contemporaneous
perhaps with the vast pile at the western extremity of
Ormskirk old church, thus with the very earliest ecclesiastical
remains extant in Lancashire. Here, too, we
have a beautiful example of the ancient lych&ndash;gate.</p>

<p>Soon after the Restoration the Hutte would seem to
have been relinquished as a place of residence by the
local family. A new one at all events was built in
1674&mdash;the Hale Hall of the present day&mdash;mentioned
above as the seat of Colonel Blackburne. Like many
another first&ndash;class country&ndash;house, in style it is substantially
domestic, extremely comfortable to look at, and no
doubt well appointed within; but still neither in outline
or physiognomy can it be said to preserve the traditions
of any particular school of art. The park is spacious,
full of fine trees, including many lindens, so valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
wherever men are sagacious enough to set up beehives.
It supplies, also, many a delightful prospect, especially
when the eye crosses the water and rests upon the
opposite distant hills of North&ndash;West Cheshire, which are
said to resemble very strikingly the rising grounds about
Bethany and Bethphage. The gardens have great historic
interest, since it was to Hale that the famous collection
of plants once existing at Orford Mount was transferred,
these including vines now two or three centuries old, but
still prolific of grapes. Vines in this healthful village
seem comfortable anywhere, mounting, as in the south,
to the cottage eaves, and outstripping in their beautiful
green ambition even the honeysuckles.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ALL lovers of the woods and fields are interested
in our native birds. Many of their
sincerest pleasures are associated with birds;
they listen for the song of the thrush in
early spring; for the note of the cuckoo,
inestimable herald of the summer, voiceful
when all else is voiceless, magnet of the heart in quiet
evenings as we tread the rising grass or scent the new&ndash;cut
hay;&mdash;and when the corn is awaiting the sickle, for the
<i>crec crec</i> of the land&ndash;rail. So with the sweet spectacle of
the little nests, hidden away in the hawthorn or ancient
ivy&ndash;bush. So again with the graceful movements of very
many,</p>

<p class="center small">

<p class="noindent">the lengthened undulations of the yellow wagtail; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
flutter of the goldfinch about the thistle&ndash;stems; the rich
and massive sailing of the rooks when homeward bound,
so grand, in particular, as they descend to their night
covert in the trees. &#8220;Who was it,&#8221; asks Mr. Bright, who
so happily applied to rooks the lines in the sixth &AElig;neid,
where Virgil, speaking of the descent of &AElig;neas and his
guide upon the Elysian plains, says,</p>

<div class="poem10">

<p>We propose, accordingly, now to add a brief account
of the ornithology of the district these Rambles cover,
so far, at all events, as regards the immediate neighbourhood
of Manchester. The detailed observations upon
the habits of the various species as originally given in
the &#8220;Walks and Wild flowers&#8221; were, as stated in that
work, supplied to a considerable extent by two old
friends, both long since deceased, Samuel Carter and
Edward Jacques. Many others will now be found, and
for these we have chiefly to thank Mr. Charles E. Reade.</p>

<p>When Dr. Latham published his famous history of
birds, exactly a hundred years ago, the number of ascertained
species, in all countries, was about four thousand.
It is now beyond question that the number is not less than
eleven thousand, and many others no doubt exist in
remote corners of which little or nothing has yet been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
learned. Europe contains a fair proportion of the great
total. So does old England individually. The Rev. F.
O. Morris, in his six well&ndash;known volumes, the first of
which is dated 1863, describes and figures no fewer than
three hundred and fifty&ndash;eight, or about a thirtieth of the
whole number, which, very curiously, is just about the
same proportion as that of the inhabitants of the British
Islands to the aggregate of the world in general. In
this list are included the genuine Ancient Britons, the
aborigines, the birds that never go away, hence called
&#8220;Permanent Residents;&#8221; the migratory birds, or such as
come for awhile in summer or winter, hence called
&#8220;Periodical Visitors;&#8221; and, thirdly, the vagrants, the
lost, and the adventurous, collectively called &#8220;Casuals.&#8221;
The introduction of the last&ndash;named, though legitimate,
gives, it must be confessed, a certain deceptiveness to
the figures. In the whole range of natural history there
is no fact more interesting than that birds, in their airy
voyages, often wander inconceivably far from home, so
that in all countries solitary examples of different kinds
are met with in turn, not one of them perhaps ever revisiting
that particular spot. Well may the poets, that is to
say, the philosophers, find in birds the representatives
and emblems of human thought, which, as we all know,
travels illimitably. To give these casuals, however, a
place in the catalogue commensurate with that of the
aborigines, the birds residing in the country all the year
round, or even with that of the established visitors,
which, like the cuckoo, never forget their appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
season, is manifestly to introduce confusion. At least
fifty out of Mr. Morris&#8217;s three hundred and fifty&ndash;eight
have not occurred more than once or twice in any part of
Great Britain; and another hundred are particularised as
&#8220;extremely rare.&#8221; To say that there are about two hundred
British species is thus nearer the truth as regards the
established denizens of our island&mdash;the birds we are
familiar with, or with which we may become so by steady
watching; and of these, proper to our own neighbourhood,
there would seem to occur within a few miles of
Manchester about ninety. The number of permanent
residents mentioned in the &#8220;Walks&#8221; is fifty&ndash;nine, and of
regular summer and winter visitors between twenty&ndash;five
and thirty; if there is any difference at the present
moment, the changes of twenty&ndash;four years will certainly
not indicate increase. Why we have no more than about
one&ndash;half of the proper ornithology of the country is that
Lancashire is too far to the north, and its climate too
damp and chilly, for many of the summer immigrants
from beyond the channel, though some of these have
no objection to visit the adjacent county of York; while
in respect of the winter visitors from the colder parts
of the Continent and the Baltic regions, we are rather too
far to the west. If few in comparison with the possessions
of more favoured districts, the ninety or a hundred are
still enough to be proud of and to rejoice in. It is with
birds as with wild&ndash;flowers: we do not want lengthy catalogues,
but that which shall gladden the heart. A single
life&ndash;history, followed up in every little particular, supplies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
exactly as in botany, more real and lasting enjoyment
than acquaintance, however sounding, with a score of
mere shapes and measurements, and resting therein.</p>

<p>The parts most abounding in birds are naturally those
which supply food in the greatest abundance. The peat&ndash;mosses,
the cold and treeless hills have their inhabitants.
Still, it is where fruit abounds, and where the insects
depending on vegetation are most numerous, that birds
must always be expected to gather in largest numbers.
Trees and substantial hedgerows are also inviting, so
that, all things considered, the southern and south&ndash;western
parts of the neighbourhood are probably the
richest both in number of species and of individuals.</p>

<p>The simple fact of so many as ninety of the prettiest
and most interesting of the birds accounted British being
denizens of our own district should operate as a strong
inducement, especially with young people, to commence
earnest study of ornithology. If the gathering and
examination of ferns and wild&ndash;flowers be a perennial
pastime, quite as hearty is the enjoyment that comes
of observing the forms of birds, always so elegant, the
diversities of their vestures, their odd and entertaining
manners and customs, their ingenuity, characters, and
tempers, their almost human instincts, and their incessant
prefiguration of human character. This last is, in truth,
not simply one of the most curious and amusing parts of
ornithology, but literally the inexhaustible part. The
best and most precious lessons in natural history, whatever
may be the department, are those which enable us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
to trace the harmonies between the lower forms of life
and our own, seeing that man is not so much contained
in nature, as the continent of it, the summary, compend,
and epitome of all that is outside of him, and of all that
has gone before. It is not necessary, as some seem to
suppose, that we should <i>shoot</i> every unlucky bird we may
desire to be acquainted with. The museums are now so
amply stocked with good stuffed specimens, that there is
no need for further slaughter, unless under peculiar circumstances;
all that we may want to know about form
and colour is procurable indoors, and the best part of
the subject is always that which is followed up with our
eyes and ears in the fields. There is no harm in killing
birds, any more than in the insecticide of the entomologist,
so long as necessary for the genuine purposes of
science; but to make a point of bringing down every
poor wayfarer that may come within range is wanton
cruelty. Instead of glorying in the destruction of a rare
bird, or of a brilliant butterfly that an instant before had
been waving its painted fans like an animated flower, it
should rather be matter of regret that it has now been
prevented from any longer brightening the earth and air,
and that the beauty of the world has been thus much
defaced. If a bird in the hand be worth two in the
bush, a bird in the woods, rejoicing in the freedom of
nature, is worth twenty in a museum or a glass case.</p>

<p>Assuredly, too, it is a great mistake to shoot down
birds because of the damage they do in orchards and
corn&ndash;fields. Caterpillars, grubs, and flies of various kinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
multiply in precisely the degree that pains are taken to
protect the fruit by destroying the birds disposed to
attack it. The prudent man, instead of killing all he
can, knows that his best policy is so to alarm the invaders
that they shall go away of their own accord. Birds of a
feather not only flock together, but, as every ornithologist
knows full well, can confabulate. Warned by the discharge
of small shot such as will do them no harm, they
soon discern that mischief is brewing, and though, like
boys, they will &#8220;try it on&#8221; again, by and by they take
their departure, and conscience is not smitten with the
reflection that, after all, the poor creature was more of a
friend than an adversary. By killing off birds systematically,
not to say malevolently and vindictively, those
who do so strive their best to exterminate a leading
section of the sanitary police of nature. No policy is
more short&ndash;sighted; it is the opprobrium of the present
day, and if persisted in will induce results that, when too
late, will be deplored.</p>

<p>While speaking thus of the wanton destruction of birds,
let it be added that the words apply with equal force to
the wanton destruction of flowers and ferns. Gather
what can be applied to good and useful purposes, but <i>no
more</i>; and as regards roots, never dig up anything that
cannot be relied upon as quite sure to take kindly to the
garden or the rockery it is destined for. All true
naturalists love to contemplate Life, and living things,
and no one deserves the name who wilfully and wantonly
or even heedlessly puts things to death, or who treats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
them in such a way that they will presently be sure to
die.</p>

<p>Let us proceed, however, with our list, adding only
that the original localities of 1858 have all been allowed
to stand, so that it may be seen what Manchester
possessed then, if not to&ndash;day. The scientific appellations
are those which lead off the lists of synonyms given by
Morris. To facilitate reference to his useful work, the
volume and the number of the plate are cited after
every name, the plates being counted as No. 1 and
thence onwards up to 358.</p>


<h3>I. PERMANENT RESIDENTS.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Kestrel, or Windhover</span> &#40;<i>Falco Tinnunculus</i>&#41;, Morris, vol. i., pl. 17.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common, building in woods, especially where little
disturbed by visitors. One of the most beautiful
and harmless of its race, and remarkable for hovering
over its prey, which is often a field&ndash;mouse. It
may be seen suspended in the air by quick, short
flapping of the wings, sometimes for five minutes,
then dropping down upon its victim with wonderful
speed and force.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Sparrow&ndash;hawk</span> &#40;<i>Accipiter Fringillarius</i>&#41;, i., 19.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common, a bird of great daring, and a very general
and successful destroyer of smaller ones, pouncing
at once upon its prey. Usually builds in a tree
which commands a good view in every direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Short&ndash;eared Owl</span> &#40;<i>Strix brachyotus</i>&#41;, i., 23.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Frequently found on the mosses. Two upon Trafford
Moss in the winter of 1858&ndash;9.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The White or Barn Owl</span> &#40;<i>Strix flammea</i>&#41;, i., 29.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common. The most frequent, familiar, and useful of
the British owls, being a great destroyer of mice and
young rats, therefore especially valuable to farmers
who have granaries. Often laughed at because of
its &#8220;stupid&#8221; look, the owl is a bird of consummate
interest. The great size of the eyes is adapted
to the small amount of light in which they are
usually to be employed. In the broad light of
day the poor creature is dazzled, and may well look
irrational. Mark also the beautiful fringe around
the eyes. This prevents the interference of lateral
light, and the bird can concentrate the whole of its
power upon what lies immediately before it, just as
we ourselves shade the eye with the hand, and curve
the fingers, when we want to examine some distant
object more particularly.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Song Thrush</span> &#40;<i>Turdus musicus</i>&#41;, iii., 127.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Everywhere in the district, and its sweet voice known
to every one. In congenial seasons it begins to sing
in February. The nests, with the eggs, are brought
every year to the market for sale. In the work of
no creatures more than of birds, as in higher circles
of life, is there more of &#8220;love&#8217;s labour lost.&#8221; But
to balance extreme lack of wisdom, so great in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
present instance is the perseverance, that if in
endeavouring to raise a brood it is foiled by one
of its many enemies, the thrush almost invariably
follows that good old rule, &#8220;try again.&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Missel Thrush</span> &#40;<i>Turdus viscivorus</i>&#41;, iii., 124.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common, breeding freely and very early, and building
a nest similar to that of the song&ndash;thrush, but in
rather slovenly fashion, and usually very conspicuous,
being placed in the forks of the branches of
trees. Any odd stuff is used for it, as pieces of
torn&ndash;up newspaper, bits of old flannel, stray cotton&ndash;wool,
old ribbon, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Blackbird</span> &#40;<i>Turdus merula</i>&#41;, iii., 131.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common everywhere, restless and vigilant, breeding
freely, known to every one, and a great plague to
gardeners. Blackbirds, however, consume so many
snails, that in the matter of spoiled fruit we can
quite afford to be lenient.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Hedge Sparrow, or Dunnock</span> &#40;<i>Accentor modularis</i>&#41;,
iii., 135.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common, and especially attached to gardens. Begins
to sing towards dusk, never any sooner; then mounts
to the highest twig it can find near its nest, and is
tuneful to the highest degree, saying, as well as a
bird can, &#8220;Home, home, sweet, sweet home, my
day&#8217;s work is done, like yours; good night, all&#8217;s
well.&#8221; A more exquisitely beautiful and immaculate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
shade of blue than that of the eggs it is scarcely
possible to discover.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Robin, or Redbreast</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia rubecula</i>&#41;, iii., 136.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Universally known and beloved; very fond of visiting
timber&ndash;yards in the town during the winter, where it
sings freely; and in the country an excellent prophet
of the weather, for if the next day is to be fine,
the robin mounts to the top of the tallest tree; if the
contrary, it warbles softly underneath. The young
birds are nearly the colour of throstles, the distinctive
hue not appearing till after the first moult. At this
period the bird seems patched with red, presenting a
most comical appearance.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Stonechat</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia rubicola</i>&#41;, iii., 140.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Seen every winter in the neighbourhood of Withington,
haunting the Swedish turnip fields. In the summer
it lodges elsewhere.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Golden&ndash;crested Wren</span> &#40;<i>Regulus cristatus</i>&#41;, iii., 162.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">This bird builds annually in the yews in the grounds at
Dunham Hall, and is common on the outskirts of
the town generally. The note resembles that of a
weak cricket, and is often repeated, as if the little
creatures, like children, were afraid of losing one
another. The male and female are never seen
apart, and usually there are three or four couples
together.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The Great Titmouse</span> &#40;<i>Parus major</i>&#41;, i., 36.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common, haunting woods and gardens, and busy
most of its time in looking for insects and spiders.
Imitating other birds, and making all sorts of queer
noises, the reward it often gets is to be shot for its
pains, the wonder being what droll creature can it
be.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Blue Titmouse</span> &#40;<i>Parus c&oelig;ruleus</i>&#41;, i., 39.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Very beautiful in plumage, usually a sweet light blue
or dark blue and yellow, common in woods and
gardens, and building its nest in holes of trees, in
letter&ndash;boxes, old pumps, and anything else that has a
cavity in it and it takes a fancy to. In late autumn
and winter there is no prettier sight than to watch
one of these elegant little creatures pecking away at
one of the two or three apples that a kind&ndash;hearted
man always leaves for it.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Cole Titmouse</span> &#40;<i>Parus ater</i>&#41;, i., 37.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common, but chiefly found in winter, usually going
northwards to breed.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Marsh Titmouse.</span> &#40;<i>Parus palustris</i>&#41;, i., 40.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Similar to the last both in habits and note, but building
more frequently.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Long&ndash;tailed Titmouse</span> &#40;<i>Parus caudatus</i>&#41;, i., 41.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">The nest, which is usually suspended from the ends of
branches in the thick of the hedge, is most beautifully
formed, and resembles a little bee&ndash;hive. It is
constructed of moss, lichens, and spiders&#8217; webs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and lined with feathers, as many, when pulled out
and scattered abroad, as would fill a couple of hats.
In autumn, parties of about half&ndash;a&ndash;dozen usually go
about together, scampering through the orchards,
generally from east to west, examining every tree with
remarkable rapidity, always moving, never resting;
after which they are not seen again perhaps for months.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Pied Wag&ndash;tail, or Dish&ndash;washer</span> &#40;<i>Motacilla
Yarrellii</i>&#41;, ii., 80.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A common and very elegant bird, building under
bridges, and near the water, but always in some
rough or stony place, such as a hole where a brick
has fallen out. Haunting stream and pond&ndash;sides in
quest of food, it is quite as particular as a lady is
over her dress, flirting its little tail so as to preserve
it from getting soiled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Gray Wag&ndash;tail</span>, &#40;<i>Motacilla sulphurea</i>&#41;, ii., 82.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Similar to the last in habits, and very beautiful in its
breeding plumage, showing yellow, blue, black,
white, green, and many other tints. Near Manchester
rather rare.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Meadow Pipit, or Titling</span> &#40;<i>Anthus pratensis</i>&#41;,
ii., 86.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common in meadows and upon the mosses, as Chat
Moss and White Moss, on which it breeds abundantly.
This bird has most young cuckoos to rear
of any of the feathered tribe that build on the
ground, and a good deal of work to do, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
young cuckoos are both big and hungry. It is one
also of many which, if they think their young are in
danger, feign to be wounded, so as to draw attention
away from the nest.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Skylark, or Lavrock</span> &#40;<i>Alauda arvensis</i>&#41;, ii., 93.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common everywhere, building on the ground. The
male bird seems to collect the materials, while the
female employs herself in arranging them. Seldom
alighting upon either tree or bush, the lark, rather
singular to say, is, except when soaring, in its habits
almost wholly terrestrial.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Bunting</span> &#40;<i>Emberiza miliaria</i>&#41;, ii., 97.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Not infrequent, singing, in a shrill note, in March, on
the tops of trees near cultivated fields. The nest is
built on the ground, near the sides of ditches.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Black&ndash;headed Bunting, or Black&ndash;cap</span> &#40;<i>Emberiza
sch&oelig;niculus</i>&#41;, ii., 98.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common about pit&ndash;sides and wide ditches.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Yellow&ndash;ammer</span> &#40;<i>Emberiza citrinella</i>&#41;, ii., 90.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common. The song, in March and April, is very
peculiar, and sounds like the words, &#8220;A little bit of
bread and no ch&ndash;e&ndash;e&ndash;se,&#8221; the first part of the sentence
uttered rapidly, and the latter long drawn out. &#40;This
name, often mis&ndash;written yellow&ndash;<i>h</i>ammer, represents
the German <i>goldammer</i>, literally &#8220;yellow&ndash;bunting.&#8221;&#41;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Chaffinch</span> &#40;<i>Fringilla c&aelig;lebs</i>&#41;, ii., 102.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common. A very early harbinger of spring, in woods,
fields, and gardens, and very fond of orchards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
building a beautiful nest of all sorts of materials
within reach. One has been found constructed
entirely of raw cotton. The eggs are sometimes
blue, sometimes white with pale spots, or pinky, or
red, as if pencil&ndash;marked. Named <i>c&aelig;lebs</i> by Linn&aelig;us,
because in winter, especially when the season is
severe, in many parts the sexes say good&ndash;bye to one
another, and live asunder till spring, when they
re&ndash;unite. One of the neatest in habits of all English
birds. Even in the depth of winter the chaffinch
seeks a lavatory every day.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Tree Sparrow</span> &#40;<i>Passer montanus</i>&#41;, ii., 104.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A sharp little bird, not uncommon, and usually building
in hollow oak&ndash;trees. If the tree be approached
during incubation it flies off like a shot.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The House Sparrow</span> &#40;<i>Passer domesticus</i>&#41;, ii., 105.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">The bold, pert, quarrelsome bird, indifferent alike to
our kindness and our enmity, which nevertheless one
is glad to see feeding on the crumbs considerately
thrown to it from the parlour breakfast&ndash;table.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Greenfinch</span> &#40;<i>Coccothraustes chloris</i>&#41;, ii., 106.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common in cultivated fields and gardens. Song
sweet but monotonous.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Linnet</span> &#40;<i>Linaria cannabina</i>&#41;, ii., 110.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Abundant everywhere on heaths and in hedgerows.
Many are kept in cages for the beauty of the song.
Not only among mankind, it would seem, does a
fine voice sometimes prove the road to ruin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Less Red&ndash;pole</span> &#40;<i>Linaria minor</i>&#41;, ii., 111.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">This bird breeds in Marple Wood, Cotterill Clough,
and similar places. The nest, rather hard to
discover, is round, the size of a racket&ndash;ball, and
composed of fibrous roots and the hemp&ndash;like bark
of the dead nettle&ndash;stalks of the previous year, with
which the little architect ties them together, the
inside being lined with the pappus or down of the
coltsfoot seed. It is generally placed in high
hedges or in the boughs of fir&ndash;trees.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Bullfinch</span> &#40;<i>Loxia Pyrrhula</i>&#41;, ii., 114.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Rare. Remarkable for the beauty of its nest, which is
constructed of the withered ends of the slenderest
woodbine twigs the bird can find, laid crosswise like
a woven fabric. Generally found in a bush, and
about a yard from the ground.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Starling, or Shepster</span> &#40;<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>&#41;, iii., 121.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A bird well&ndash;known as stopping up waterspouts with its
nest, and never going to bed till after a prolonged
chatter. Common everywhere.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Carrion Crow</span> &#40;<i>Corvus corone</i>&#41;, i., 52.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Formerly common in Hough&ndash;end Clough, but now
extinct, and fast disappearing from the neighbourhood
in general.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Rook</span> &#40;<i>Corvus frugilegus</i>&#41;, i., 54.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common everywhere. Their clamour one of the most
familiar of rural sounds, and their great feathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of the only shade of black that is lively, constantly
seen lying upon the ground.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Jackdaw</span> &#40;<i>Corvus monedula</i>&#41;, i., 55.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Formerly an inhabitant of the steeples of St. John&#8217;s,
St. Anne&#8217;s, St. Matthew&#8217;s, and St. Mary&#8217;s churches.
Plentiful wherever there is an old ruin.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Magpie</span> &#40;<i>Pica caudata</i>&#41;, i., 56.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Formerly very abundant about Urmston, but has become
scarce with the disappearance of the tall trees,
especially poplars, once so plentiful there. It suffers
sadly, also, from sportsmen and gamekeepers.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Jay</span> &#40;<i>Garrulus glandarius</i>&#41;, i., 58.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Frequent about Withington, Didsbury, Northen,
and in that part of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Green Woodpecker</span> &#40;<i>Picus viridis</i>&#41;, ii., 64.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">This bird used to breed in Dunham Park. One was
seen there in January, 1859.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Great Spotted Woodpecker</span> &#40;<i>Picus major</i>&#41;,
ii., 65.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Rare. Dunham Park; Barlow Moor.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Creeper</span> &#40;<i>Certhia familiaris</i>&#41;, ii., 62.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Abundant, but, in consequence of its retired habits,
little known. At a short distance it looks like a
mouse, running up the tree from the very bottom,
and clearing it all round of every insect that may
happen to be in the way. Plentiful at Gatley Carrs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Wren</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia Troglodytes</i>&#41;, iii., 160.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Well&ndash;known, and common everywhere in gardens,
woods, and hedgerows. Often found with a few
scattered white feathers, and sometimes with white
wings. The large and pretty nest reminds one of
what women do for the world. The hen commences
one and completes it. Meantime the male bird
begins two or three in succession, a short distance
from his mate&#8217;s, but never completes one of them.
The materials are moss, feathers, hair, dead leaves,
and dead fern.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Peewit, or Lapwing</span> &#40;<i>Vanellus cristatus</i>&#41;, iv., 192.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common everywhere in marshy grounds, and known
to most people by the peculiar cry represented in
the name. The young ones are particularly fond of
being in the bottom of deep ditches and drains,
squatting down close to the ground.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The King&ndash;fisher</span> &#40;<i>Alcedo ispida</i>&#41;, i., 46.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Cheadle, Urmston, Flixton, and elsewhere in those
directions, by all the tributaries of the Mersey. A
beautiful but very timid bird, darting with great speed,
its glossy green back glancing quick as thought.&mdash;&#40;See,
in reference to the Lancashire localities, the
<i>Manchester Guardian</i> of Feb. 4th, 1882.&#41;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Moor&ndash;hen, or Water&ndash;hen</span> &#40;<i>Gallinula chloropus</i>&#41;,
v., 247.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common by old pits. Many breed on the ponds in
Dunham Park, where we cannot go in the summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
without seeing them in companies of four or five,
their little white tails cocked up, and looking as if
they were swimming on their necks.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Great Crested Grebe</span> &#40;<i>Colymbus cristatus</i>&#41;,
v., 294.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">On all the Cheshire meres, Tatton, Tabley, Rostherne,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Little Grebe, or Dab&ndash;chick</span> &#40;<i>Colymbus Hebridicus</i>&#41;,
v., 298.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common on the Cheshire meres.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Nuthatch</span> &#40;<i>Sitta Europ&aelig;a</i>&#41;, i., 60.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Dunham Park, but only a few.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Ringdove, Cushat, or Wood&ndash;pigeon</span> &#40;<i>Columba
palumbus</i>&#41;, iii., 164.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Breeds in the woods in Trafford Park and about Chat
Moss; plentiful about Urmston, though rather rare
in the district generally.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Stockdove</span> &#40;<i>Columba &aelig;nas</i>&#41;, iii., 165.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Very scarce. Marple Wood.&mdash;&#40;On the Lancashire
localities, see <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, Jan. 21, 1882.&#41;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Red Grouse</span> &#40;<i>Lagopus Scoticus</i>&#41;, iii., 172.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">On the moors.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Partridge</span> &#40;<i>Perdrix cinerea</i>&#41;, iii., 174.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Upon farm&ndash;land, common.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Wild Duck</span> &#40;<i>Anas Boschas</i>&#41;, v., 270.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">This bird breeds on Carrington Moss, Chat Moss, and
in many other places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Heron</span> &#40;<i>Ardea cinerea</i>&#41;, iv., 197.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">In the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> of December 28, 1881, it
is stated that there is a heronry &#8220;within about
fourteen miles of the Exchange,&#8221; and that within
forty miles of Manchester there are a dozen other
stations for this beautiful and celebrated bird. The
former is probably that one which it is further stated
has existed since 1871 in Tabley Park, though the
older stations, Dunham Park, Oulton Park, and the
trees near the water at Arley Hall, have long since
been deserted.&mdash;&#40;<i>Vide</i> also the <i>Guardian</i> of March
18th, 1882.&#41;</p>


<h3>II. PERIODICAL VISITORS.</h3>

<h4>I. COMING IN SPRING AND SUMMER.</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Wheat&ndash;ear</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia &OElig;nanthe</i>&#41;, iii., 142.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">The earliest of our summer visitants, coming by the
end of March, but staying in the fields not longer
than two or three weeks, when it moves off to the
mountainous districts to breed. Very fond of placing
its nest in deserted rabbit&ndash;holes, and in cavities in
old stone walls.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Grasshopper Warbler</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia locustella</i>&#41;, iii., 143.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">No one who has heard this bird can ever forget it, the
note resembling the voice of the grasshopper, but
prolonged into a whirr, like the noise of a spinning&ndash;wheel.
Towards midnight, when all other birds are
still, if approached, it will begin. Found haunting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>thickets and hedge&ndash;bottoms, but rather uncommon,
and rarely seen, though often heard, on account of
its habit of running among the low brushwood.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Sedge Warbler</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia salicaria</i>&#41;, iii., 145.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common by the sides of pitsteads. This is the bird
so often mistaken in our neighbourhood for the
nightingale. No bird takes more care to let us
know of its presence; the moment it is disturbed, it
begins to sing.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Black&ndash;cap Warbler</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia atricapilla</i>&#41;, iii., 150.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A most beautiful song&ndash;bird, and common in woods.
When it arrives, it is fond of mounting high into the
trees; the males, like most of the warblers, coming
a week or two before the females, and selecting a
station, where they sing until their mates arrive.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Garden Warbler</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia hortensis</i>&#41;, iii., 152.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Unlike the preceding, this bird never gets up high into
the trees to sing, nor does it care to warble until the
female arrives, when its lovely trill is heard plentifully
in the low bushes. It will build in gardens
among peas. Common in Hough&ndash;end Clough and
about Urmston.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Whitethroat</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia cinerea</i>&#41;, iii., 153.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common everywhere, and apt to warble when on the
wing, springing up out of the hedge, with its jar&ndash;jar&ndash;jar,
jee&ndash;jee&ndash;jee, and in a minute or two diving down
into it again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Less Whitethroat</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia sylvicella</i>&#41;, iii., 154.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Rare about Manchester, building in hedges a large
and clumsy nest, similar to that of a greenfinch.
The song is given only from the very heart of thick&ndash;foliaged
trees.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Wood Warbler, or Wood Wren</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia sylvicola</i>&#41;,
iii., 155.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A very lovely little bird; its song, or trill, a repetition
of two notes, and its nest very hard to find.
While singing, it sits on the bough and seems to
tremble, the wings being quivered elegantly.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Whinchat</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia rubetra</i>&#41;, iii., 141.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A common little bird, breeding everywhere, usually
selecting uncultivated lands, and sometimes hay&ndash;fields,
but always having its nest upon the ground.
About Urmston it is known as the &#8220;utic,&#8221; from its
peculiar cry, &#8220;tic, tic, utic.&#8221; In habits sprightly and
cheerful, popping about for ever from one spray to
another.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Willow Warbler, or Willow Wren</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia
Trochilus</i>&#41;, iii., 156.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">This little fellow is common in most places,&mdash;woods,
gardens, hedgerows,&mdash;choosing the top of the trees to
sing in. It ceases to sing after pairing, devoting
itself to the construction of its large nest, which is
usually protected with a lid, and built of grass, moss,
and feathers. In the summer of 1858, Edward
Jacques found a nest in Hough&ndash;end Clough, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>dead blackbird alongside, from which the feathers
had all been plucked, and used in the construction.
Nowhere is it more numerous or happy than about
Urmston, arriving clean as a daisy, after its journey
of a thousand miles or more.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Chiff&ndash;chaff</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia rufa</i>&#41;, iii., 158.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">This little creature, which is one of the smallest of the
warblers, arrives a trifle later, or about the middle of
March, when it at once begins its cry in the very
highest branches it can find of the tallest poplars
and fir&ndash;trees, perching itself on the topmost pinnacle.
Not common about Manchester generally, though
plentiful in Marple Wood. First it cries &#8220;chiff,&#8221;
then &#8220;chaff,&#8221; then &#8220;chaff&#8221; and &#8220;chiff&#8221; alternately.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The White Wag&ndash;tail</span> &#40;<i>Motacilla alba</i>&#41;, ii., 81.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Arrives at the end of March or the beginning of April,
but does not appear to breed in our neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Yellow Wag&ndash;tail</span> &#40;<i>Motacilla flava</i>&#41;, ii., 84.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common in open fields, building its nest among young
corn, and in hay&ndash;grass. Like all the other wag&ndash;tails,
a bird of very poor song, but singularly gentle
and affectionate. It arrives the last week in March,
apparently all the better for its journey, the plumage
being often more clean and beautiful the day of
arrival than at any later period.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Redstart</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia ph&oelig;nicurus</i>&#41;, iii., 138.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Formerly very common in Hulme, Chorlton, and
Withington, but now become scarce, being shy in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>temperament, and retiring before the advance of
population. Plentiful in the rural parts of Cheshire.
To get a full view of a redstart is also very difficult,
as it is for ever dodging behind a branch, and, as
the name implies, is never still.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Tree Pipit</span> &#40;<i>Anthus arboreus</i>&#41;, ii., 88.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A lively bird, arriving at the beginning of April, and
commencing to sing immediately. Common, building
its nest on the ground, and laying the most
variously coloured eggs, some being blood&ndash;red and
others deep black.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Cuckoo</span> &#40;<i>Cuculus canorus</i>&#41;, ii., 71.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Arrives abundantly about the 27th of April, remaining
until about August, though young birds of the year
have been found in October. However disregardful
of its young, the cuckoo makes ample amends in its
conjugal fidelity, for when one of either sex is seen,
you may be quite sure that its mate is not far off.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Wryneck, or Cuckoo&#8217;s Mate</span> &#40;<i>Yunx Torquilla</i>&#41;,
ii., 61.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Rare, coming mostly with the cuckoo, which it somewhat
resembles.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Swallow</span> &#40;<i>Hirundo rustica</i>&#41;, ii., 76.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common and familiar everywhere. Social, harmless,
and useful, and perhaps as much beloved as the
robin itself, if only because of its fondness for
human habitations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The House Martin</span> &#40;<i>Hirundo riparia</i>&#41;, ii., 79.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common and familiar, and, like the swallow, always
welcome. This odd bird often takes for the foundation
of its nest one constructed the previous year by
the swallow. The swallow&#8217;s nest is open at the top.
The house&ndash;martin likes to have a roof or lid, so goes
on with the one it adopts till finished to its own
fancy, keeping only an aperture for ingress.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Sand Martin</span> &#40;<i>Hirundo urbica</i>&#41;, ii., 78.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Comes in spring from North Africa and Malta, then
common everywhere in sand&ndash;banks, in which it
excavates horizontal galleries. It never alights on
the ground, but gathers the blades of green grass
used for the nest while on the wing, and in the same
way collects the feathers for lining it.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Dotterel</span> &#40;<i>Charadrius morinellus</i>&#41;, iv., 187.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">This bird visits us in the beginning of May, arriving
in large flocks. It is very tame, silly, and easily
approached. If a fowler once gets among them, he
may shoot the whole before they take alarm. It
remains only for three or four days or a week, and
then moves on to its breeding stations among the
mountains in the north.&mdash;&#40;On the Lancashire
localities, see <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, Feb. 25, 1882.&#41;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Spotted Fly&ndash;catcher</span> &#40;<i>Muscicapa grisola</i>&#41;, i., 44.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common, making its appearance in the middle of
May, building in gardens and woods, and generally
choosing very odd situations for the nest. Remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
for the constancy of its return to the same old
dead tree or rail, or old and ivied wall. After its
long a&euml;rial sail it seems well content also to stop
there till the time for departure in autumn. &#8220;From
morn till dewy eve&#8221; it keeps in its chosen place,
though incessantly darting out to secure a fly.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Pied Fly&ndash;catcher</span> &#40;<i>Muscicapa luctuosa</i>&#41;, i., 43.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">This bird has been seen frequently between Middleton
and Oldham, where also it builds its nest, choosing
old trees.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Sand&ndash;piper</span> &#40;<i>Tringa hypoleucos</i>&#41;, iv., 217.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Tolerably common on the banks of the Mersey at
Northen, and thence down the river.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Land&ndash;rail, or Corn&ndash;crake</span> &#40;<i>Crex pratensis</i>&#41;,
v., 242.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Common everywhere in hay and corn&ndash;fields. The voice
of the corn&ndash;crake has in it something so nearly akin
to ventriloquism that the birds themselves are rarely
where we seem to hear them, furnishing in summer
much pleasant amusement.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Spotted Crake, or Gallinew</span> &#40;<i>Crex porzana</i>&#41;,
v., 243.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">These birds haunt the pit&ndash;bottoms, and cannot be got
without a good dog; hence they appear to be less
common than they really are.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Quail</span> &#40;<i>Perdrix coturnix</i>&#41;, iii., 178.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Occasionally met with, and no doubt breeds, like the
partridge, which it resembles, in open fields. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
may be known by its peculiar cry in summer evenings,
<i>But&ndash;me&ndash;but! But&ndash;me&ndash;but!</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Dipper</span> &#40;<i>Cinclus aquaticus</i>&#41;, iii., 123.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">The only place in the neighbourhood known to be
visited by this curious bird is Stalybridge Brushes,
from which nests and eggs have several times been
brought. At home only in and about brooks and
streams in mountainous districts, it generally builds
its nests under the ledge of a cascade on rocks
perfectly wet, having to go through the curtain of
water to reach it. When wishing to feed, it goes to
the bottom of the water, there walking about like a
diver.&mdash;&#40;On the Lancashire localities, see the <i>Manchester
Guardian</i>, Feb. 4, 1882.&#41;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Ring Ouzel</span> &#40;<i>Turdus torquatus</i>&#41;, iii., 132.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Builds every summer in Stalybridge Brushes; occasionally
about Withington. Remarkable for its loud and
beautiful song.</p>

<h4>II. VISITORS COMING IN AUTUMN AND WINTER.</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Field&ndash;fare</span> &#40;<i>Turdus pilaris</i>&#41;, iii., 125.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A common winter visitor, breeding in Norway and
Sweden, and one of the eminently social birds,
always travelling in large companies. Comes about
the end of October, and leaves again not later than
the beginning of April.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Redwing</span> &#40;<i>Turdus iliacus</i>&#41;, iii., 126.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">The habits of this bird are the same as those of the
field&ndash;fare, with which it comes and goes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Siskin</span> &#40;<i>Carduelis spinus</i>&#41;, ii., 109.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">The siskin visits us in November and December, but
sometimes not for seven or eight years together,
though coming plentifully when it chooses to make
its appearance.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Mealy Red&ndash;pole</span> &#40;<i>Linaria canescens</i>&#41;, ii., 112.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Comes and goes in flocks with the siskins, and at
equally long and uncertain intervals.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Snipe</span> &#40;<i>Scolopax Gallinago</i>&#41;, iv., 227.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Abundant, haunting old brick&ndash;pits and unfrozen brooks;
plentiful about Gorton, Belle Vue, and Cheetham
Hill.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Jack Snipe</span> &#40;<i>Scolopax Gallinula</i>&#41;, iv., 228.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A smaller bird than the common snipe; not so plentiful,
but often seen in company with it.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Woodcock</span> &#40;<i>Scolopax rusticola</i>&#41;, iv., 225.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Formerly very plentiful about Hough&ndash;end, but now
rare, owing to the filling up of the pits and the
clearing away of the brushwood.</p>

<h3>III. CASUAL, STRAY, AND OCCASIONAL BIRDS.</h3>

<p>Several of the birds named below are permanent
residents in the British Islands, and others are regular
visitors to this country. They are put in the present
place because seen near Manchester only at uncertain
intervals, or as casuals, the only one that can be looked
for with any degree of probability, being the sea&ndash;gull.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
The visits, as will be seen from the dates, have in some
cases occurred at periods so far back, that except for
completeness&#8217; sake, they would scarcely be worth mention.
I quote them from standard works upon ornithology, and
from the late Mr. John Blackwall&#8217;s paper upon the
migrations of Manchester birds in the &#8220;Transactions of
the Literary and Philosophical Society for 1822,&#8221; the
observations having been made during the eight years
1814&ndash;1821.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Little Crake</span> &#40;<i>Crex pusilla</i>&#41;, v., 244.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">One at Ardwick in 1807.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Golden Oriole</span> &#40;<i>Oriolus galbula</i>&#41;, iii., 133.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">One near Manchester in 1811.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Ortolan</span> &#40;<i>Emberiza hortulana</i>&#41;, ii., 101.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">One near Manchester in 1827.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Crossbill</span> &#40;<i>Loxia curvirostra</i>&#41;, ii., 116.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">About the year 1840, in the month of August, a large
flock of these birds, old and young in company,
visited Hough&ndash;end Clough for a few hours. Mr.
Blackwall gives as its Manchester period, August 5th
to November 19th.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Chatterer</span> &#40;<i>Ampelis garrulus</i>&#41;, i., 59.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">In Mr. Blackwall&#8217;s list.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Hoopoe</span> &#40;<i>Upupa epops</i>&#41;, i., 49.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">In Mr. Blackwall&#8217;s list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Red&ndash;backed Shrike</span> &#40;<i>Lanius collurio</i>&#41;, i., 34.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Sometimes seen in the summer.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Great Shrike</span> &#40;<i>Lanius excubitor</i>&#41;, i., 33.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">In Mr. Blackwall&#8217;s list, and was seen at Cheadle about
1850. &#40;On the Lancashire localities of the three
species of Lanius, see the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> for
March 11th, 1882.&#41;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Merlin</span> &#40;<i>Falco &aelig;salon</i>&#41;, i., 16.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">In Mr. Blackwall&#8217;s list. &#40;On the Lancashire localities,
see <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, January 14th, 1882.&#41;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Dusky Grebe</span> &#40;<i>Colymbus obscurus</i>&#41;, v., 296.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Once near Manchester.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Bewick&#8217;s Swan</span> &#40;<i>Cygnus Bewickii</i>&#41;, v., 262.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A flock of twenty&ndash;nine at Crumpsall on December 10th,
1829, and another of seventy&ndash;three at the same place,
February 28th, 1830.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Little Bittern</span> &#40;<i>Ardea minuta</i>&#41;, iv., 205.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A very shy and sulky little bird, sitting all of a heap,
and looking like a bit of brown stump.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Bittern</span> &#40;<i>Botaurus stellaris</i>&#41;, iv., 204.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Great or Solitary Snipe</span> &#40;<i>Scolopax major</i>&#41;, iv., 226.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Has been seen at Urmston.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Nightingale</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia Luscinia</i>&#41;, iii., 147.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">The visit of the nightingales to our neighbourhood will
long be remembered by those who heard their song.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
It took place in 1863. The first came to Wilmslow
early in May, establishing itself in the little grove
near the end of Bollin Hall Park, on the Manchester
side of the railway viaduct. For several weeks it
sang nightly, and the crowds of people who were
attracted by the fame of the bird from distances of
many miles, at last became quite a trouble to that
usually quiet neighbourhood. The second took up
its lodging in a grove close to the Strines Printworks,
where, says Mr. Joel Wainwright,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> no greater sensation
was ever caused by a little thing. It began at
ten every night, and continued almost uninterruptedly
until three a.m. A third is said to have visited a
plantation adjacent to the railway station at Sale,
but over this one there may possibly have been an
error.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Snow Bunting</span> &#40;<i>Emberiza nivalis</i>&#41;, ii., 95.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Occasionally visits us in severe winters, breeding in
Norway and Sweden.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Mountain Finch, or Brambling</span> &#40;<i>Fringilla montifringilla</i>&#41;,
ii., 103.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Visits us from the north in winter time, but rarely.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Pectoral Sand&ndash;piper</span> &#40;<i>Tringa pectoralis</i>&#41;, iv., 239.</p>

<p>Once by a pit near the White House, Stretford Road.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Wild Goose</span> &#40;<i>Anser palustris</i>&#41;, v., 251.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">A flock of these birds was once seen feeding in a field
at Withington.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Wild Swan</span> &#40;<i>Cygnus ferus</i>&#41;, v., 261.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">One preserved in the Peel Park Museum was shot
near Bolton. Occasionally seen at Lymm.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Sclavonian Grebe</span> &#40;<i>Podiceps cornutus</i>&#41;, v., 296.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">One shot near Oldham many years ago is now in the
Peel Park Museum.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Tern</span> &#40;<i>Sterna Hirundo</i>&#41;, vi., 316.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Occasionally seen upon the Mersey and the lower
Irwell.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Black Tern</span> &#40;<i>Sterna nigra</i>&#41;, vi., 323.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Black&ndash;headed Gull</span> &#40;<i>Larus ridibundus</i>&#41;, vi., 331.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Gull</span> &#40;<i>Larus canus</i>&#41;, vi., 334.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Kittiwake</span> &#40;<i>Larus tridactylus</i>&#41;, vi., 340.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Gulls are frequently seen in the winter on the mosses
and in ploughed fields, feeding, but whether they
are the kittiwake or common gull cannot always be
ascertained with certainty, as they are very shy birds,
and fly away before they can be approached.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Water Rail</span> &#40;<i>Rallus aquaticus</i>&#41;, v., 246.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Curlew</span> &#40;<i>Numenius arquata</i>&#41;, iv., 211.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Occasionally breeds on Chat Moss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Teal</span> &#40;<i>Anas crecca</i>&#41;, v., 272.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Occasionally seen by pit&ndash;sides.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Black&ndash;start</span> &#40;<i>Sylvia Tithys</i>&#41;, iii., 139.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Two were seen at Didsbury about 1855.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Golden Plover</span> &#40;<i>Charadrius pluvialis</i>&#41;, iv., 186.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Occasionally seen in large flocks upon the flat fields
near Stretford and thereabouts.&mdash;&#40;On the Lancashire
localities, see <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, January 28th,
1882.&#41;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Ringed Plover</span> &#40;<i>Charadrius hiaticula</i>&#41;, iv., 188.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Single birds are seen occasionally, both in summer and
winter.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Storm Petrel</span> &#40;<i>Procellaria pelagica</i>&#41;, vi., 353.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">One was picked up alive near Stockport in the winter
of 1856, and another, dead, at Pendleton, shortly
before. A third had fallen at Withington, these
birds being blown inland by tempestuous weather,
and dropping when exhausted.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Hobby</span> &#40;<i>Falco subbuteo</i>&#41;, i., 14.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Once near Brooks&#8217; Bar, as a summer visitant. The
hobby is the only British bird of prey that is
migratory.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Dunlin</span> &#40;<i>Tringa variabilis</i>&#41;, iv., 240.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">This bird has been known to breed on Chat Moss, but
very rarely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Swift</span> &#40;<i>Hirundo apus</i>&#41;, ii., 73.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Occasionally.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Night&ndash;jar</span> &#40;<i>Caprimulgus Europ&aelig;us</i>&#41;, ii., 72.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">Chat Moss, and other out of the way moors.</p>

<h3>IV. INTRODUCED AND NATURALIZED.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Common Pheasant</span> &#40;<i>Phasianus colchicus</i>&#41;, iii., 169.</p>

<small>NATURAL HISTORY IN THE LIBRARY.</small></h2>

<div class="poem10">
<p>As he who southward sails, beholds each night,<br />
New constellations rise, all clear and fair;<br />
So, o&#8217;er the waters of the world, as we<br />

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE immense value of the Manchester libraries
to the student of Natural History has already
been mentioned. Treasure&ndash;houses at all
times, it is impossible to over&ndash;estimate the
privileges they confer on rainy days. &#8220;Some
days,&#8221; says the poet, must needs be &#8220;dark
and dreary.&#8221; We have all, at some time or other, had
our plans and projects baffled by the wet, and very
disappointing it certainly is, when a nice party has been
made up for an afternoon&#8217;s pleasure in the country, to
see the sky grow black and the drops begin to fall, with
not a chance of its clearing up until too late to go. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the streets lead the way to as much pleasure, after
another manner, as the field&ndash;paths. It is nothing but a
thoughtless mistake which lauds the country at the
expense of the town, crying out that God made the one,
but that the other is the work of man. Each is complementary
to the other; each, as with the sexes, affords
pleasures which itself only can give; each is best in turn,
and full of compensation, and whatever may be thought
of the adjacent country, no town is more enjoyable to
the intelligent, by virtue simply and sufficiently of its
Free Libraries, than Manchester. With these inexpressibly
precious stores at perfect command, the private
property, virtually, of every man who takes interest in
their contents, let none, then, ever deplore rain, or
piercing winds, mud, snow, sleet, or any species of
atmospheric hindrance to rural pleasure. More lies
within the walls of our three great Free Libraries than a
life&ndash;time is sufficient to consume. To the student of wild
nature they are peculiarly valuable, since they supply
interpretation of everything that can possibly come before
him in the fields.</p>

<p>The books in our three great Free Libraries&mdash;the
Chetham, the City, and the Peel Park&mdash;which deal with
zoological subjects, and with pal&aelig;ontology, are easily
discoverable, the number of important ones, especially
such as have plates, being limited. The printed
catalogues, and the courtesy of the respective librarians,
give ready information as to these, and the titles of the
various works generally indicate the contents with sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
clearness. With works upon botanical matters it is
different. The number of these is too vast for any
librarian&#8217;s easy reference, and to ascertain what ground
they cover also very generally requires personal examination.
In the aggregate, the three Free Libraries contain
quite a thousand distinct and independent works of this
latter class&mdash;books treating of floriculture as well as of
botany&mdash;very many of them single volumes, but the
average the same as that of the fashionable novel, the
grand total being, in other words, over three thousand, a
weight of literature pertaining to plants certainly without
parallel in any other English city after London. Our
remaining space we shall devote accordingly to a select
list of the botanical works, old and new, enumerating
them in chronological order. For in the eyes of the
accomplished student fine old books always count with
the great kings of history,</p>

Unlike the Didsbury sycamore, which was in the prime of its princely

the rigour of the winters beginning in 1878 received injuries from
which it could not possibly recover.</p></div>

which Townley had in the compilation of the &#8220;Guide,&#8221; we merely
wish to give honour where honour is due, neither on the one hand

application, as in the case of Wessenden Clough <a href="#Page_150">&#40;p. 150&#41;</a>, naturally
passed on to similar defiles destitute of trees. Not fewer probably
than a third of the cloughs mentioned in the present volume are of
the latter character.</p></div>

of supreme vigour, in the spring of 1877, and the cottage is now
occupied by a totally different family. Mere Clough, too, is not
what it was. Though spared the desecrations of Boggart&ndash;hole,
the grove of fine trees that once filled the bottom has disappeared.
The best of the wild&ndash;flowers have also disappeared, or nearly so;
and the brook is less often limpid than impure. Similar changes
have overtaken everything public in the neighbourhood.</p></div>
